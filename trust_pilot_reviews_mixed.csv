"I'm very unhappy with the service that I received from sales representatives Samantha Thrush @ TRESL. Sales rep. Samantha dragged her feet with the sale and promised that I would not be charged any rental fees for her lack of response to my multiple phone calls. The company AVIS Rental charged me over $2400.00 for rental car fees, even though I committed to purchasing the vehicle. This $2400.00 charge caused my checking account to become overdrawn, which the manager said, ""they were NOT responsible for"".  I WOULDN'T SUGGEST THAT ANYONE PURCHASE A VEHICLE THROUGH TRESL! DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!",0,Negative
Anthony Tumminello Was amazing he was very informative and answered all my questions and concerns. Good addition to your company as a Manager,1,Positive

"I used Tresl for financing my car. They automatically assumed that I would want GAP insurance and when I had stated I would not that included in my plan, the financial advisor made an inappropriate backhanded comment about me having “disposable income”. The communication was horrible. When I had mentioned the lack of communication after many attempts of trying to reach my financial advisor she became defensive and disrespectful. And after a week after requesting all documents and me sending them in she mentions to me that I needed to submit something else. I assumed after she told me I submitted something successfully the week prior and everything was fine, but it was clear to me she didn’t thoroughly go through my documents. This is turn slowed down the process. After realizing that she did not have my best interest at heart I requested a new financial advisor. His communication was much better, but I never got a call back stating that my lender approved everything. After contacting the lender on my own, I was able to see that I was approved for the loan. I have never written a review for anything in my life, but I was so appalled and the disservice and unprofessional attitude of my original advisor, considering people are potentially spending thousands of dollars.",0,Negative

I am very pleased with the service and end product.  I purchased my new vehicle a year ago at a time where I had no credit.  I paid an extremely high interest rate knowing I had to read-establish.

Overall good service,1,Positive
This Company helped me out a lot and I thank them their Employee Jeff Was a big help and stayed true to his word!,1,Positive
"The rep I worked with was great!  He was professional, courteous, and proactive in helping answer questions and moving things forward.  The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the actual interest rate was nearly around .75% higher than the original quote.  I expected some sort of fee, however when you add the $300 fee to the interest rate to calc your APR, the effective rate wasn’t much lower than what I’m already paying.  Plus the APR was not initially disclosed when I first received a summary of the actual interest rate.  All this said, they are easy to work with and provide great service.  However, I don’t feel like the time was worth the savings for me and there may have been a similar or lower rate locally. I just didn’t have the time to check around.  So if you need a company to assist you with refinancing your auto loan, they are good and you’ll likely get a better rate. But if you have time to do your own research first, do it.  At the very least you may have greater appreciation for the service that Tresl provides.  Thanks",1,Positive

"I wanted to implement a buyout of my leased vehicle at the end of my lease.  Apparently Florida tries to force buyers to return to the dealer for buyouts with hefty fees. ( Legislative initiatives). The TRESL agent  was able to find a bank that could finance the buyout with attractive rates and payments within my budget and avoid the ( bogus) dealer fee.  I felt that she was truly working on my behalf.  She was responsive and followed up timely.  Even with her many ongoing loan applicants, she remained focused on my individual needs and lent that “personal rapport” to each conversation. She literally walked me through the process...a lengthy but necessary submission of documents.  The loan is secured and I am pleased to own my formerly leased vehicle!",1,Positive
Their representative Kevin Lazar made applying for a refinance my auto loan easy.  Mr. Lazar sent me a link to upload all the required documents via my smart phone.  Once the documents were received the whole process took about two weeks to complete the transaction.  Mr. Lazar kept me informed during the process of the auto refinancing with the new lender.  Mr. Lazar is friendly and professional .  I would recommend TRSL and Mr. Kevin Lazar to my friends and anyone who needs to refinance their auto loan.  Mr. Lazar told me he only send my refinance request to lenders he knows that would approve my loan.  I would highly recommend TRSL to anyone.,1,Positive
"This was my first time buying a car remotely.  The experience was good and I am not unhappy with the results.  Having been a senior level business leader for many years, I understand the effect a situation such as the current pandemic can have; however, as it has been progressing for some time, I was a bit unhappy with the time it took (and is still taking) to compete some rather simple tasks.  While my financial advisor is pleasant and easy to work with, it seemed that the time it took (and in one case is still taking) to get some answers and/or actions was a bit excessive. Sometimes, advisors need to ""bug"" his/her support team occasionally to ensure prompt action(s) are taken. But, as I stated previously, it has been a generally pleasant experience.",1,Positive
I had a chance to work with K.C. who was absolutely wonderful in explaining what she needed and my steps to complete to refinance my vehicle. Overall the transaction was easier due to her availability to me and willingness to answer any questions that I had.

Kevin was very helpful! I was able to get my car refinanced to a much better rate and it was a pretty easy process. He also answered any questions that I had as well with no issue.,1,Positive
For the last 3 weeks I have not had steady communication Iv had horrible experience with my advisor he contacts me late and don’t return calls even when I call someone they put me on hold and hangs up so at this point really have given up on refinancing thru them if this is what’s it like now I can only image how else everything else will be I had that they already ran my credit which put hard inquiries on my credit,0,Negative

"I had a good experience with Tresl. Even when I made mistakes, they helped me resolve the problem with ease. I would absolutely recommend them.",1,Positive
"The service received starting from test drive to phone conversations with the Tresl service agent and the finance person was all very professional. They also walked me throughout the process, from testing to financing. There is one incident that I suggest needs to be improved, my first Avis vehicle scheduled test drive was cancelled on the same day. I was my way to see the vehicle then I was called less than 1 hour before the scheduled time and told that the vehicle was no longer available and had damages. Which is a good thing, but that could have been conveyed much sooner than the day of. The second time around, the other vehicle, which I did purchase, was on time at the pickup facility. I can't say whether the first incidence was a one-off, but all other services received were as expected, so thank you to the team of folks I worked with for being reliable and helpful through this process.",1,Positive

"I first started inquiring with Tresl in July. Nobody got back to me. Then I contacted them in September and they said yeah, yeah, no big deal. Can we offer you extended warranty? Give us this paper, this and this, and we'll take care of it, so I signed the contract and another month went by, meanwhile I am still making payments to my original lender. I reached out again. This time Tresl gave me someone who actually responded. We got everything read to go, contract signed and then it they misplaced the insurance information. Then all the sudden they need ten years of employment and two personal references. I am still waiting... Edit> The loan went through. I am so happy! The manager called to make sure everything was good. I am so thankful to be out from under the high interest loan from my original finance company.",1,Positive
Had a rate change in the middle of this transaction. This prompted all the paperwork to be sent to a 2nd time. No one reached out to me before nor after the paperwork was sent a 2nd time to explain to me what was going on or why i was receiving the paperwork a 2nd time. It wasn’t until i called 3xs that i got in touch with Miram that explained what was going on. I really feel it was a break down in communication.,1,Positive

"Slow service, nearly impossible to contact. Our agent didn’t respect our requests ie that we worked at 3pm and to call before that time. He consistently ignored our requests and called while we were at work and made it incredibly difficult to proceed forward with the process. Then whenever we tried calling, we were on hold for at least 30 minutes only to be told he was unavailable. Unsure why this was so difficult but I would never do this process again in the future. Shockingly, it’s easier to deal with car dealers way more than to do this process. We still haven’t gotten our Title, registration, or anything except the car bills and it’s been 4 months.",0,Negative

We were told by the car agent we could haggle on price. The car wasn't cleaned like a rental car I would like.   When we finally got someone the gentleman said he didn't care, Tresl isn't selling the car so do you want it or not? Then we had a warranty added on without our knowledge or consent. Agent was upset we denied the warranty and tried to argue taking it off.   We liked the paperwork not having to be at a car dealership but wasn't explained in any way.",0,Negative
"Kevin was great in handling our transaction. He was delightful to work with and extremely helpful. We originally had our own financing set up for the purchase of this vehicle, but Kevin got us a better interest rate and was a breeze to work with.

"Tresl was better than expected! Jeff Hazzard made the process as simple as could be. There were some negative reviews on Yelp but my own experience relates to more of the great reviews from Credit Karma. They saved me $50/mo, cut my rate almost in half, and made sure all the docs were in order with no unexpected surprises. Great job! -Dave H Tampa, FL",1,Positive

Very helpful for buying out lease. Good customer service. I worked with Caroline who was very responsive and helpful.,1,Positive
"Overall, horrible experience in my opinion.  Manager rude and could frankly care less if you are happy or not.  Was arrogantly chuckling as I was talking to him.  He had no idea what customer service is.  I ended up buying the car so I can speak from experience.  I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere.  Finance person got combative when I was trying to decline warranty which they obviously get commission for but wouldn't disclose that.  You dont want a finance person who avoids questions about who is making money off of you.  I'm happy its over and wouldn't shop here again.  There is more but just trust me, save yourself the head ache.  Thanks",0,Negative
"Angel did a great job!!! He was awesome. The process sucked though. The information I had to provide was a bit ridiculous. It is easier to get a passport, driver’s license, credit card, etc.., then get this small loan. I feel sorry for Angel because I know he did not make near what he should’ve on this loan for all the work that he has done.",1,Positive
Great service,1,Positive
"Sorry to leave a bad review, but there was no follow-up to schedule a “Ultimate Test Drive.” Tenya said the vehicle I requested was no longer available and would call back after consulting with Avis team sales, but she did not. I scheduled my own appointment online and later received a text message that the order didn’t go through and asked if they could book for me. I replied yes. I texted the day of the test drive to confirm my appointment with no response. I called to confirm and there was no appointment. I don’t need to work this hard to buy a vehicle. I’ll take my money elsewhere.",0,Negative

"Very pleased with Tresl and Aaron for getting my truck refinanced. I am going to save over $70.00 a month!

"I was trying to purchase an automobile through here. I picked out the auto i liked, got approved for the loan through USAA, and made a reservation Thursday to take a test drive this morning at 9am. When I arrived at avis I was informed that the auto was not there, and no one knew when it would be available. I called and emailed I lthe trustpilot agent with no response. I called back again and had to escalate my problem to management. I received a call back saying that the car was in Chicago, and I would have to close my case. I made a loan specifically for this vehicle, plus out of 3 hrs of work traveling to avis. I am very disappointed in the service I received, and wonder why my bank would even promote these people! If I could put zero stars i would do so! And yes, a manager did reach out to me, but didn't try to help me at all. Basically tried to talk me into changing my review,  and tried to wiggle out of the situation by saying it wasn't their fault because the are a third party. I am a small business owner, and I survive on good work ethic, good customer service, and word of mouth. I don't place the blame on anyone, i just get it right. Not these people!",0,Negative

"I bought a 2019 Kia SOUL Hatchback for $12,924 in mid-May (Avis Albuquerque) but refused their offer to sell me an extended warranty I was already given for free by the manufacturer.  Tresl/IFS then sent the title transfer info to Albuquerque (my town), or so they said. It's going into the 4th month and my insurance company advised me that I stand to be fined and lose my driving privileges if I don't produce the title transfer data that they need. I suspect TRESL doesn't know where they sent the info.  TRESL keeps ignoring my pleas. I'm driving without car registration and don't have my own car plates.  Is it legal what they are doing? Can anybody suggest how I can return the car before they get me in trouble? This is now going into the 4th month and I am desperate.",0,Negative

You can always get in touch with her whenever you need her help! My load rate is decreased from 8.2% to 3.2%. I bet you can almost never find a lower one. I highly recommend Tresl and I highly recommend Aimee as your finance advisor.",1,Positive

Thank you! I appreciate your assistance,1,Positive
George was very Professional and easy to talk to He explained everything from a to Z he went Above and beyond to ensure that the paperwork the experience went well.

"After the original dealership tried to charge me some ridiculous fees to buy out my lease, I looked into other options and found Tresl. I worked with Don throughout the process and he was absolutely wonderful. He explained the process clearly, worked hard to get my loan closed quickly, and saved me thousands of dollars. I couldn’t be happier with my experience. Thank you!",1,Positive
"Tresl was a pleasure to deal with but the individual Avis rental location in Carle Place, NY was anything but. Not Tresl's fault though. Wound up buying elsewhere for other reasons but would work with Tresl in the future. Pam Showels was a great help and really on top of her game.",1,Positive
I applied online to refinance my car and within minutes I was contacted by Juan who is one of Tresl's Financial Advisors.  He was both professional and knowledgeable and kept in touch with me throughout the process in regards to documents needed. It took a total of 3 weeks to close on the loan.  I went from an interest rate of over 16.99% to 4.0 and I'm saving over $70.00 on my monthly payments. Thank you Juan!  Christin,1,Positive

"Credit Karma directed me to Tresl, and Ashley was a saint.    Ashley prepared me with the the types of emails, signature requirements and systems used, as well as what I would have to do on my end with getting a notary for signatures and documents needed for the FedEx envelope.  She answered any questions I emailed her, and phone calls were great.  Only once did we have a little issue and that was because of internet system failures which are out of both of our controls. The most difficult part of the process was getting to a FedEx site for quick delivery.",1,Positive

"The process was a lot more difficult than I anticipated. Miscommunication and lack of follow up. I wont use an online finance process again if at all possible. You can walk into a car dealership and purchase a car, with financing, within  a few hours. It makes no sense to endure this process over several weeks.",1,Positive

Even though Tresl is not partnered with Nissan, my agent Jeff was extremely efficient and helpful in arranging and expediting the process. This is the second time I have turned to Tresl for aid in processing a lease buyout and both times they have managed to exceed my expectations on the ease and excellent loan rates obtained.    I certainly would recommend this route for anyone wanting to butout their lease quickly and with minimum stress.",1,Positive

"Thanks for making the refinancing of our Jeep such an easy and smooth process. We were so nervous about the whole idea of it; however, we are grateful for this opportunity to improve our interest rate and gain extra benefit protection for our Jeep.

Eric was fantastic in facilitating my car loan. He was prompt on things we needed and needed to give him. He called to follow up regularly. Highly recommended!,1,Positive
Great experience! Much easier than dealing with a Bank. I would recommend Tresl  to everyone.,1,Positive
"Overall Tresl was a good experience. I give 3 stars instead of 5 because the customer service was much to be desired, the representative I was assigned was great for the first two days until I committed to the offer. Once I committed I could no longer reach her, nor did she ever return my call. At the end they did what they said they would do and did find a lower interest rate and did lower my payments. I would do business again, I would just hope that the customer service was better.",1,Positive

"Went through Avis car sales.  Tresl handled the title work and financing part of the vehicle purchasing process.  Whole process was easy. No pressure, no hidden fees, everything was clear and straight forward.  Had one miss communication, but it was resolved without headache.  Would definitely consider going through process again for next car, not having to go through a dealership is a big plus.",1,Positive
This was the smoothest process that I've ever experienced in receiving financing. Jon was very helpful and explained everything perfectly.,1,Positive

"Kim Winner was a lifesaver!  I hadn’t had a car loan in more than 10 years so was rusty on the process.  Kim walked me through everything, was great at answering questions, and easy to get in touch with.  Very grateful for Kim & Tresl making this a smooth and easy process!",1,Positive
Dan did a great job!!!   I would use them again on my next purchase of an automobile.,1,Positive
"Pretty easy process, got me a refinance with a way better interest rate and lowered my monthly payments by $80 a month. Thank you!",1,Positive
"The loan process was not as harassing as I thought. After getting prequalified a soft run was made on my credit history to get an interest rate. This was just a 2 minute phone call step. I got a rate that was right up my alley and began gathering paperwork for the process. The representative was helpful during the process, she was available through text, phone, and email; which was really good. I would recommend Tresl to others because the steps to getting a loan was simple.",1,Positive
Easy to apply. Fast approval. And excellent attention.,1,Positive
First my financier was very helpful and informative but then after I signed everything he never wanted to answer any phone calls or get back to me if I had any questions. It was a painful process to have to try and sit here idle because I’m not going to be informed on the progress of my loan and what’s going on. His job is to answer the phone and he couldn’t even manage to do that. So if you want to know anything call the bank directly because this guy isn’t going to help you.  Edit: A supervisor at Tresl has contacted me and said that they were going to deal with this guy. Tresl did save me money by lowering my interest rate and dropping my monthly car note which I do appreciate. So because I was contacted I’m raising my one star to a three star.,1,Positive
"This is my first time purchasing a high value car, and I was nervous about all the high pressure sales tactics that are used in this industry. (I'm in the New York area).   Well, the people at your company that I dealt with (Jayson Peebles and Darla Burn) were anything but that. Throughout my communication with them, I got the sense that they genuinely were trying to help me.  My first reservation was for a Camry at a decent price. 10% below value..  But it turned out, after the reservation was confirmed and we got the nitty gritty details, that the car was bright red.  It was not pictured the way  on Avis's website.  Jayson tipped me off that Toyota's website will provide all the precise details of each car, just by supplying the VIN, and he always checks the color there. That was helpful to know!  So we changed the booking to another Camry. But by this time, the market prices had shifted, and Avis was no longer offering the generous 10% below book value pricing that they had been when the first booking was made. The prices were now $1000 more than before.  Guess what ? Jayson vouched for me and explained the situation with the color, and Avis agreed to lower the new car to be where the first car's pricing was.  And when the day of my pickup fell out on his day off, Jayson emailed me the night before with the heads up, so that I can contact someone else in customer service without delay.  Another interesting thing. I show up at Avis, and since the test drive is treated like a rental, the counter person goes around the car and notes all the dings and dents. He pointed out to me that there was a crack in the bumper, and I might want to consider that. Wow! The seller is actually being helpful to the buyer.  So after the test drive, I went back to Jayson with the crack information. He suggested I reach out to Darla Burn, who is handling the financial part of the deal. She was happy to help, and told me that I should expect an answer within an hour's time.  Sure enough, an hour later, she called with the news from Avis; they agreed to lower the cost of the car to cover the bumper. Wow. This is after already agreeing to keep the price of my red car reservation  But it's more than that. Darla doesn't just email. She calls, and was so pleasant on the phone. She clearly explained the process, and was happy to be of help.  She explained exactly what it would cost to finance, and what the interest rates and dealer fees would be, and what factors influenced the dollar amount.   She even suggested a low cost quick fix for the bumper issue.",1,Positive
"Sara Edwards was awesome!!! She made the entire refinance process quick, hassle-free and transparent. She assisted me with every step of the process and helped me feel confident in choosing the best lender for my refinance.

"While the deal took a while to complete, everyone I interacted with at Tresl was kind, courteous and professional in their handling of my auto purchase entirely remotely - very convenient, especially given that I live thousands of miles away from their office. In particular, my sales representative Sara Edwards did an exceptional job following through on the case and making sure that everything was falling into place - graciously mediating between titling, financing and my funding institution, with exceptional dedication. Her service and approach made a big difference in my early decision process. Earlier when I was scheduling my drive test with Avis, Jayson Peebles in Customer Service was also extremely helpful in making sure that I could test exactly the vehicles I wanted to see in my neighborhood Avis location, making what could have been an arduous process a smooth, straightforward experience. Some of the call center experience at Tresl can be confusing, however this is very much made up for by representatives like Sara E and Jayson P. Thanks to them, I managed to get the vehicle I loved, never feeling abandoned or lost in the process. Thank you!",1,Positive
Mitchell made the lending process quick and easy. A pleasure to work with him.,1,Positive

"The refinance process was overly complicated and burdensome. The loan agent was difficult to work with and lacked critical thinking. For example, he couldn't figure out why my yearly income was low and my biweekly was high. I had already mentioned I had been on maternity leave, but instead of reaching out for clarification, he just went ahead and denied me. I had to contact him again to fix it. Also, when I needed information about the process / fees it was like asking 20 questions. One word answers without any additional clarification. I'm still glad I did the refinance, but it's been a headache. I would recommend Tresl, but not my loan agent. I should have requested a different one in the beginning. I wonder if that would have changed my experience.",0,Negative
"Caroline is amazing! She has offered me nothing but exemplary customer service, integrity and efficiency! 98% of the times I have called Caroline she answers right away . Any concerns or questions I have had have been answered almost immediately. If she doesn't know the answers she takes action right then and there to figure it out. Most definitely deserves a promotion!!!",1,Positive

"My experience at first seemed to go like a traditional loan. It was towards the end when returning documents to finalize my car loan when I made a mistake on a form,I asked my loan officer if I should reprint the form since it needed to be notarized. She suggested For me to cross out what I signed in front of the notary and resign to be legal. I did what the professional loan officer told me. I got an email back that the form I crossed out was not valid and that I would have to go and get the forms signed again. She did apologize but I reiterated to the loan officer you told me it would be fine. Her response to me was YUP! I responded YUP I like doing reviews. I advised in customer service don’t use YUP. I am not a friend or family member. I felt so disrespected and thought about going elsewhere for my loan. I will not blast your name but please work on your customer service!!",0,Negative

I would recommend this to anyone closing out a lease to buy.",1,Positive
Don dalton was an amazing person who helped me throughout and It was great experience working with him. Whereas I found that that Tresl Employees has gap in communication. I found it loosely coupled and because of that I had to re e-sign many times and had to go to notarized documents twice and twice to shipping company for sending the singed documents. Overall experience was below average and it took more than a month to fund the loan.  Again Don dalton was great to work with.  Thanks!!,1,Positive

To be frank, I think all my future purchases will be online and I would use Tresl again without even batting an eye. You have a great team and thanks again for your help.",1,Positive
"The agent that helped me through the entire process, Laura Deen, was one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. Every question I had she answered quickly and with great information.

"Everything worked out very smoothly. It was easy to communicate and exchange information. However, purchasing a vehicle through means of online and over-the-phone exchange is a little unsettling.

Anthony however called me and explained the reasons why, apologized for the confusions and went out of his way to attempt to get me a refi loan. He really did tried unfortunately what he was able to get was higher than my current. Great company, amazing customer service! Really looking forward to working with them once my credit score can get a little higher!",1,Positive
"I worked with Kim from the beginning to the end. After the test drive, we decided to purchase the extended passenger van for our small private school. As the finance officer, I was getting nervous about the turnaround time on our loan approval and having possession of the van which was still under a rental contract. She assured me that the rental fees would not be charged as long as we went through with the purchase. Sure enough, no rental fees were charged. Kim was quick to respond to my emails and phone calls. She even continued to help weeks after the loan funded. The windshield was cracked, and Avis agreed to replace it at no charge. It took several calls and emails, but it was finally replaced yesterday. The delay had nothing to do with the service Kim provided (she was great) but I did want to wait until the replacement was complete before submitting a review.",1,Positive
"At first I was very disappointed with my experience; however, I must say that the car sales team at Tresl pulled through with an unbeatable deal in the end. My sales manager, Joe, specifically dedicated himself working overtime on his weekend off to price match me on a much better vehicle after the first one fell through. Even though the situation was out of his hands, he took personal responsibility and put in some incredible effort to come through with an unbeatable deal. Job well done!",1,Positive

"first called no call back. One week later checked for truck, gone (presumably sold) 2 weeks later found another listing for a nissan frontier pro 4. Called avis they can't sell cause it is a franchise. Called the fran chise. Told me that they cant sell cars to anyone in Washington! Unreal.    So called another number somewhere in midwest. called 3 times all I got was continuous music. No id nothing. Tried 3 times left phone off hook after good 5 minutes get an answer. The guy was pretty helpful, I explained situation and he said he would straighten it out and call me back. 2 days later NO response.   It isn't worth the aggravation and a 4.5 hour drive to see and test and likely buy the truck. I can see myself getting there only to find the truck unavailable for who knows what reason.",0,Negative
Great customer service!,1,Positive
Excellent!!! My experience with Juan was conducted in a very professional manner.   The process was simple and seamless.   I would highly recommend Tresl.,1,Positive
I worked with Kim Winner and she was amazing! Thank you so much for your efforts and promptness.,1,Positive
"I started with one rep who seemed bothered by my questions.  She sent electronic paperwork which I replied to promptly.  Then I'm contacted by someone else who is taking over for her.  He has none of my paperwork.  The process is slow and confusing.  There is a time difference which also complicates communication.  I also believe there are things that should be explained up front.  I think purchasing a home is easier than this!    Although my rep Terrance tried his best to be available, I believe the company has a process that is far more complicated than it needs to be.    Although I believe I found a good car at a fair price, I would never recommend going through Avis/Tresl.  There are other companies that are much easier to do business with, even if it cost a bit more.",0,Negative
"I was told conflicting information regarding the purchase price. I was told that I would not be charged for the test-drive rental (I was), and then that the amount I was charged for the test drive rental would we subtracted from the purchase price (it wasn't).",0,Negative

parts of the tranaction worked well laura in particular  but i asked kevin 4 times for the user guide and he would say he will check on it but no follow through  he also promised to send spare key but then after asking about its status said there was no spare key available  this only happened after i complained about non response and asked for the name of some higher ups  also when i first went after the car it took three days for anyone to get in touch about arranging test drive (i did get a message saying you would be in touch soon).  I only got any communication back by placing a call,1,Positive

"This is either a bait-and-switch company, or just a money laundering scheme. And let me tell you why.  I wasted my time applying to refinance my vehicle this morning. They told me to get a ""co-borrower"". It was at that exact minute that I laughed so hard I fell off the toilet.  Me? A co-borrower?  My credit score is 790 (seven hundred and ninety).  I have a flawless, 100%, perfect on-time payment history for 19 years, for everything. Never ever been late for a single thing in nearly two decades.  I am only using 14% of my revolving credit.  And I make well over a quarter million dollars a year.   And they told me to get a co-borrower? Hahahaha!!!!!   if I can't successfully refinance my vehicle with my credentials, then don't waste your time because most likely you won't either.  ---I am adding to my initial review of this company.--- I had a rep tell me that my car ""was too old"", BUT, I NEVER EVER got to the part of entering my vehicle information!!! So, ANOTHER lie. How they came upon ANY of my 7 (seven) vehicle information is beyond me. If a vehicle is ""too old"", then why tell an applicant to get a co-borrower? Isn't it just easier to cop to what you guys are doing and admit the ineptitude of your ""business""?   If a 2018 Range rover is too old to re-finance, maybe you should broaden your variety of vehicles financed. Because, JUST LIKE I SAID BEFORE, your website IS A SCAM. You're welcome!!  Oh, BTW, I went thru NIFCU and got a refiance rate of 1.5%. Thanks for insulting me!!!",0,Negative
"It takes too lengthy process of paper works even we pay off for the car.  However, we have learned some experience about to purchase car on line.            It is not simple as it sounds.",1,Positive

"The process was very unclear, different people handled each aspect of the vehicle purchase and weren’t aware of the details of the others responsibilities. Each person redirected me back to my main advisor but didn’t help because she didn’t know the details. In the end I get the temp tags in the mail thinking I wouldn’t get them until I sent my registration paperwork in, the tags are from Texas, I have to call 3 people to find out if I can pick up my vehicle, owner hasn’t been notified that I can pick it up and so he has to call even more people. I will say everyone was nice. There were so many emails that were very short answers not explaining what the next step would be so I would have to email again. I will say everyone was very nice. I understand this is a rough time with COVID and remote workers but for someone buying a vehicle out of state it makes it impossible to plan anything. It wouldn’t be that hard, I could write something up in just a few minutes now that I’ve been through it.",0,Negative
"This company is shady.  I applied, and I was offered some auto refi choices.  I made a choice, and then someone called me.  He asked me for all this information,  so I asked him to confirm I was getting the refi choice I chose. He said yes.  I gather all my personal information he needed (DL, insurance, registration,  etc) and I upload it to him.  He then tells me he can't get me the offer I chose and the best he could do would increase my payment.  Now they have all my confidential information unnecessarily.   This is just very bad business.",0,Negative

The individual working my account did an excellent job of communicating and answering the phone when I called.

"Overall it was a pretty good experience. I think my biggest complaint would be lack of communication. There were a few times I couldn't get in touch with my Tresl Advisor and had to call the main phone number to get someone to help me out or answer my question. It was a bit frustrating at times since I was on a deadline. But, I was able to successfully buy out my lease in time, so there's that.",1,Positive

All have been very professional - and I have no doubt the entire process will be a good experience.  AND we have a great car at a great price.  Can't beat that!",1,Positive

"Update: I bought a second car - June 2020 My second car from Avis (and second time working with Tresl), and not because I was lazy or I didn’t search elsewhere; it took me 2 months and lots of research until I stumbled upon Avis having a special sale for the car I wanted at a price even less that I was willing to pay. Tresl is for Avis like that little Finance office at a dealership, but way better. At Avis the price posted is the price you pay, so no negotiations here. At Tresl I worked with Jason M. as purchase/sale coordinator, with Susan D. as customer service extraordinaire, and some other very nice ladies from Title and bank liaisons. Jason was very polite, prompt in answering the phone and e-mails, not pushy with their own finance options (I had my own finance) and the extra options for the car.  It has to be noted that the process takes 4-5 business days because they are in Texas and, in my case, I am in Arizona. However, they know what they are doing, they are explaining patiently, and the whole process is seamless.  First car - January 2020:  I bought an used rental from Avis - the test drive and the finance paperwork was handled by Innovative Funding Services. I had my own financing secured. They didn't push for their own finance or for any unnecessary extras. Chance was very prompt in answering my e-mails and phone calls and he addressed all my concerns. As long as you understand that the buying experience is different from a local dealership (they are in TX and I am in AZ) and it will take longer than the customary 4-5 hours everything will be fine. At the end of the day all the puzzle pieces fell into place and I have the car. I highly recommend Chance.",1,Positive
"Tresl was excellent on timely response with emails, calls and getting your loan approval",1,Positive
It was a very easy process!,1,Positive
"Kim Winner at Tresl was exceptionally professional to work with.  She explained the process well and stayed in touch with me and my lender throughout the process.  This is the first time I bought a car online and in a way that was not a traditional dealer or private party.  I would do it again, it was so seamless. She was very well prepared. Thank you",1,Positive

"This was a great experience - super easy and straightforward for the most part. The only thing I would have liked is a step-by-step communication about what to expect throughout the process.

"Let me start off by saying I'm a picky bas...ketball player. :-)  Then it should be no surprise that after my wife and I decided to possibly purchase a car from Avis through their ""Ultimate Test Drive"" program we booked a test drive of a silver Corolla. Then we changed our mind and went with white. We then drove that car for 3 days, and returned it and changed our minds yet again and booked another ""Ultimate Test Drive"" of another white Corolla.  The person we were working with from Avis Car Sales/Tresl was Julie Carnes.  Thanks to Julie's help, we found the car we wanted, and decided to purchase it.  Through it all, she was EXCELLENT, touched base with us several times but was never overbearing, and through all of our changes was more than pleasant and assured us she wanted us to get the car we wanted.  Her ""super powers"" were demonstrated by her sincerity and excellent customer service, she made us feel very welcome, and free to be as picky as we wanted.  She provided AutoCheck reports for each vehicle we were interested in, responded to every phone call we made, and every email we wrote to her.  We are very fortunate to have dealt with Julie Carnes, and if I was an ""Undercover Boss"" from Avis Car Sales/Tresl, you can best believe some great perks would be headed Julie's way!  Major kudos to Julie for her help & excellent customer service.  Quite a rare find in 2020. Thank you Julie!   -Jim & Linda B. - St. Paul, Minnesota",1,Positive
So far pretty good,1,Positive
"I worked with the aptly named Mr. Bills who could not have done a finer job. Before Covid shutdown retail locations, we shopped with a competitor for a car for a college-age family member, so we had some idea how this process might work. This car was for me and the whole thing was done online except the Ultimate Test Drive. (Which I strongly recommend - I had the time to really get acquainted with the vehicle, time to have my mechanic checkout the vehicle, and was even able to research the title. Everything checked out and my mechanic congratulated me on getting “basically a brand new car!” We could not be happier with our purchase and our TRESL experience. Bravo Mr. Bills!",1,Positive
"Ms Thompson has made this experience easy and pleasant. When I had questions, I was able to reach her and we were able to work out the details. Great job!!      THANKS",1,Positive

"A+.  Detail oriented, quick to respond.",1,Positive
"When I started the process I was a bit Skeptical. Just because I was doing everything on line but once the agent called me, and kept up with me step by step answering all my questions and concerns I knew I had made the right choice. This by far has been one of the best costumer service experiences",1,Positive
Bought a car through Avis Rentals.  Tresl made the process very easy.  Very positive experience from start to finish.,1,Positive
It was a better experience than what I thought it was going to be. Robert was very helpful and on top of everything we thank you for all your help.,1,Positive
The whole process was simple enough. Everyone was helpful and explained as much as possible. Recommend running your particular cars VIN through the makers website for full warranty as no one can give specifics other than the warranty provided by Avis. Overall pretty happy with our purchase.,1,Positive
Maria Solano was a pleasure to work with and very professional.  There were some glitches receiving some of the portal items and she help to resolve this. I would take this over working with a dealership every time. Thank you,1,Positive
"I am editing my original review. Initially, I gave an overall rating of 1 and now changing it to a 5. After purchasing my car I noticed a few days later it had some minor hail damage. It was hard to see but was definitely there on the hood, top of the car and the trunk. So I called a Tresl representative to find out what could be done to repair the damage really hoping it would be fixed since it was there at the time I test drove and decided to buy the car but did not see it until a few days later. This representative told me he needed to speak with a rep from Avis to find out if they would repair the damage and, if so, what the process would then be for me. A day or so later the gentleman I spoke with at Tresl called me back and told me he just heard back from his contact at Avis and who had informed him they would take care of the repair. It took about a month and a half but did get my car back this morning and it looks fantastic. Cannot see any dents from hail damage whatsoever. In addition, I must say that the person from Tresl who helped me throughout the process was very professional, always courteous, straightforward with me, and he kept me in the loop as often as he could and as often as he received new information from Avis needing to be passed along to me. So, all in all, I am so pleased with how things turned out. As far as recommending others to Tresl for those considering to purchase a car in which Tresl assists in the transaction, I certainly recommend them. They really helped me out when I needed them to and very thankful for how everything has turned out. And I still very much liking the car I bought. When editing this review of mine today I was not sure at first about what number to change it to for the overall review. I knew it was no longer a 1. I considered a 4 because, while super happy about the end result, it did take a month and a half to resolve the issue but ultimately decided on a 5 because the length of time aspect was really out of Tresl's control since the repair needed to be made by a place of Avis's choosing.",1,Positive
"Mark was simply outstanding. Professional, timely and always followed up immediately at each step. I’ve already recommended the process and Mark to friends. I’d go this route and buy brought Avis and Tresl again!",1,Positive
"Great service, they made a sometimes tedious process as easy as possible. Kim Winner was excellent in all areas of guiding us through the process.",1,Positive
"Personable, Professional and efficient.  Julie is FANTASTIC to work with.  She and the team took care of everything via email and the phone. My only concern is that they use FDX to move their documents.  Because of that it took 2 extra days as FDX did not have a convenient way to get the documents into their system.  I had to go out and find a location to drop it off.",1,Positive
"It was very shaking at first because this wasn’t the car I originally wanted to purchase and because of the representative attitude I was going to buy my car from another dealer, but an Avis employee convinced me to go back and look at a different car. During the process the new representative was very nice and answer almost every question I had except when it came to the warranty there was no paperwork that they could send me until I actually purchased the car. I have been waiting for almost 3 weeks for the maintenance logs and  my temporary tags to be mailed to me. I understand buying vehicles online is a new thing and especially during this Covid era there will be bumps in the road and everything is on a learning curve.",1,Positive

"So far my experience with Avis Auto sales through Tresl as the intermediary vendor has been a horrendous experience. I reserved a vehicle several days ago and attempted to pick it up today with no luck. Not only was the vehicle not there, when I called Tresl they said they had no idea where it was. I have now as a consequence lost the opportunity on several competitive sales based on my misfounded trust in Tresl delivering on their promises. Please do not attempt an auto-sale through this fraudulent company.",0,Negative

"From first contact with the person who arranged the test drive, everything was handled very professionally. There was no pressure to make any decisions only advice to ask any questions and be comfortable with my decisions. Emails were promptly returned and phone calls direct to service rep were either answered immediately or quickly returned. While the title transfer process has not yet been completed, I am confident that that too will be handled in a most efficient way. I highly recommend your service. Thank you",1,Positive

The process didn't take long at all and Eric was great.,1,Positive
Ms Massey went above and beyond in helping us complete the purchase.  We ended up having difficulties with the lender handling of the funding certificate which caused added stress for me during with a time we experienced a medical emergency amid COVID precautions.

I have to give it a double zero. From beginning to end the process has been nothing but a nightmare!! Can’t get anybody  to return phone calls or emails. From start I was told is an easy process!! I was told 5 to 7 days I would have my registration in my plates. Now it turns out I’m lucky to see my registration in my plate  by August. Mind you I making Car payments insurance payments for a car I can’t drive!!!! Very disappointed how I was  lead for the beginning!!! They just said anything just to get to sale!! I would advise anyone not to purchase their automobile through this company!!,0,Negative
When i called Tresl for help in refinancing my car they say no problem. I spoke with Jason Moen and he assure me i would get the best deal and he would do everything he can to make sure that happen.

"Chance was the representative who provided EXCELLENT service recovery that led to us getting our car and our loan secured seamlessly. I had a rocky start with some other reps who failed to return calls or emails, but I got transferred to a supervisor who put Chance on the call. From there, Chance took great care and was thorough. So, I was just about to give up on TRESL--I had the Ultimate Test Drive vehicle for 5 DAYS without a call from them, though I called at Day TWO. I still give them 5 STARS because Chance is EXCELLENT! We are happy with our car, happy with our loan.",1,Positive

"In terms of the rate - you guys found me the lowest rate, which obviously I’m happy about. The next best rate was Capital One at 3.75% - but the process in my opinion was slow and the communication could have been better. I don’t think it should take more than 2 weeks for a car refinance with no delay from my part. I literally  completed what was required of me the same day as well as provide needed documentation. I refinanced with State Farm for my other loan and within a day of my Submission I signed paperwork, and a couple days later State Farm was sending the payoff to the other lender. Quick, painless and efficient.  Second - the communication. I was the one reaching out to the rep to get updates. To be fair she did respond to my texts within the same day but still if there is a delay from your part or process, should be communicated quickly.  Third - A better job should be done in properly disclosing that you are a broker and what a customer may expect. My loan is going to a credit union and I was not too happy in having to create an account with the credit union and provide “references” - like is this 1990? Like no one needs to know about my business except me - if my credit, income or history is not enough don’t “approved” the loan.   Overall “so so” experience but if I had to do it over, I probably take the higher rate for a more efficient process with another lender.",1,Positive
responds quicky,1,Positive
5/5 for Tresl as of now. Just received notification of my funding. Start to finish in 12 days and may have been faster but I ended up having to send something over the weekend.

"1000 % AWFUL. BAIT & SWITCH. FRAUD??  Do not use this company. Advertised 4%, ran my credit offered 17% - I was paying 15% so score wasn't great, but greatly improved from when I first bought car. Ran my credit a few more times....came back to me at 13%...well that reduced overall interest, but I wound up putting $2800 down ($300 of which they keep as fees)....The whole process took over a month - when I executed everything they requested within minutes.....Rude, saying ""second request for info"" all bolded in red and highlighted yellow when it was in fact the first request, more than once. Reps do not respond to phone calls and emails, when I called general #, I was told I have to speak to my rep - ok how? Loan came from CCU and they funded on 5/22 but it took Tresl until 6/12 to send the payoff? NEVER AGAIN - Worst refinancing experience ever. -UPDATE- 07/03/20 Yes so what they reached out to say sorry - SO WHAT. Doesn't change my experience or the fact that I PAID them to give me such a negative experience. How about a refund?",0,Negative
Avis gave me a dirty car which I know isn’t Tresl’s fault but it’s part of the overall process. I couldn’t get financing through them and guy over the phone simply said they could not work with me (which I understand). Their whole demeanor from emails and phone calls simply seemed very cold and not very customer service oriented. It’s always best to build rapport with clients. I did get a follow up email which verbatim said “If you can get financing on your own or pay cash you can still proceed with Avis purchase”. I ended up buying a car through Carvana which no issues.,0,Negative
the process was relatively easy and quick,1,Positive
Thank you for your excellent  service.,1,Positive
Very friendly and efficient employee to work with! The loan process was pretty flawless. Once you’re approved they send you everything electrically to sign and it’s super easy! I was able to get a very low interest rate too.,1,Positive
"Staff was Professional, helpful and patient.(I had a lot of questions)  It is a different experience purchasing remotely.  Instead of a few hours of paperwork and phone calls at a dealership desk it can be a week of sending emails and FedEx envelopes. I'm purchasing an Avis fleet car but Tresl handles the sale so there can be a small disconnect.  Ex: I can't get a second key or door unlock code, current plates and toll transponder are not Tresl's problem.  I received my company's insurance card before I had temp tags.  So you are still driving a car that is technically registered to AVIS.  A little disconcerting but not a problem.  Overall Tresl did their part well and I'm just waiting on my permanent plates now.  Thank you!",1,Positive

for the most part it was good.I'd like more updates on the staus in this COVID world I ordered my car thru.,1,Positive
"The service was good, however, I thought the funding process was not easy. Between my husband and myself , our credit scores we’re in the 700’s and did not expect to be offered interest rates of 6 percent, plus!! We secured funding from our credit union at a competitive rate of 3.89 percent, what it should have been!! If Chase and Capital One, both of which I currently have accounts with, are the best finance companies you have to offer, my suggestion would be to expand the circle and find more competitive rates. We were not trying to finance a house, only a car! Day Avery was wonderful to deal with, but the finance process left a lot to be desired. Thank you",1,Positive
"The process was mostly easy.   Ashley Sinclair and Kim Winner from Tresl were great and need a raise!  The employees at the rental/sales car places were great as well.  The test drive process was a pain. Also Tresl, should give an estimate of the extra fees incurred when purchasing the vehicle.  The OTD price was $1000+ more and Tresl needs to be more up front with the price. It was still a GREAT deal, and I appreciate it.  There were definite hiccups in the ""ultimate test drive"" process, such as trashed/filthy car which was suppose to be substituted for, but wound up  testing driving the trashed car and dented car (Mandeville, LA). Next, the car that was suppose to be substituted for the trashed car was never made available until a week later in a different city (Pensacola, FL). When I went to test drive this car, I was told there was a ""registration issue"" as I was in route for the test drive 1.5 hour away. Then finally I was able to drive the vehicle 3 days later with the registration supposedly fixed, but the tag still says April?  I have purchased this vehicle (VIN ending 311) and enjoy it thoroughly so far. I hope this helps in the future, Greg",1,Positive
Once the decision was made to go forward with this purchase I was served in quickly and professionally. They did a good job.  An easy and non-complicated experience.,1,Positive
Our car buying experience went quickly and smoothly thanks to the help of those at Tresl!,1,Positive

Working with Tresl was all that I could of hoped for! They were fast and easy to work with. Aimee did an amazing job always keeping me up to date with the whole process and making sure that I was comfortable with everything. I couldn't have asked for a better rep. I will definitely recommend Tresl to everyone I know.,1,Positive
"I really dreaded going through the process of changing from a lease contract to  a purchase contract as it involved two completely different lending institutions and a ton of paperwork.  Laura of Tresl actually took care of all of the details and documents for me and did so in a friendly, patient, reassuring manner for which I am deeply grateful.",1,Positive

"My experience in finding and test driving a car has been made pain free by Luz. She was an active listener, professional, friendly and she definitely had patience. I was able to easily relay a message to her and she took care of my needs in a timely fashion. She is knowledgeable and educated me on the Tresl process. I also liked that when I had an issue she got right back with me. So if I was to do this all over again I would definitely recommend Tresl because of the excellent customer service provided to me and the smooth process I received.   Thanks again,  Tresl & Luz Robles",1,Positive
I used the service to purchase a work vehicle in the past and the communication was better,1,Positive
"i was constantly getting emails and phone calls from GMF that i owed or they hadn't received funds even though i had already wired my funds to IFS. I would call or email my IFS agent & they would be missing in action even though i would spend an hour or two of fruitless efforts trying to clear things up. If the IFS worker is going on vacation and the case is not closed they should let client know who they could contact instead. IFS is primarily a parasite company, totally unnecessary other than to skim funds off of transactions ... at least they could follow through.",0,Negative
Was amazing experience,1,Positive
"Very easy, very nice, overall a good experience.",1,Positive
Kim Winner is wonderful! She makes the process so simple and is more than helpful with any questions and working with what I wanted as a customer. She has now helped me with two(2) refinance loans and both have gone off without a hitch. Awesome Job!!!,1,Positive

"I love love love my new car! Robert Bills was fantastic to work with. This was the easiest process I have ever experienced. I bought my car from Avis. It was several thousand dollars under KBB. My mechanic checked out 5 cars for me and we both agreed on the car from Avis. Clean, well-maintained, and low miles. Tresl found me great financing with a low interest rate. Thank you to everyone involved!",1,Positive

Julie was fantastic and patient in doing this process remotely.  Thanks!,1,Positive
"The forms processing was pretty seamless.  However, the FedEx invoice provided was ""slow"" ground and took from a Wednesday to Tuesday to deliver.  For the fees paid you should get at least 2 day delivery to get the title transfer going!!!!  Phone assistance responding to questions was good.",1,Positive
Very responsive and did what they promised.,1,Positive
Good company and good service. They were able to find me the lowest interest rates and it was done efficiently.,1,Positive

"It is my pleasure to write this review so I can express my appreciation and pleasure in dealing with Maria SOLANO,Tresl Finance Advisor. Maria was completely knowledgeable of the process that I needed to close my Equus Lease and then purchase the vehicle. She was always very polite and quickly responded to my calls and emails. Maria exemplifies what customer service is all about. She is a credit to your company, Thank You Maria  Sincerely,  Ed Blyskal",1,Positive
Timely and easy to work with. Rep very friendly and courtious,1,Positive

"vehicle.   When I left your rental car agency today,  there were TWO (2) of these EXACT SE models in your car return area out back. One with Louisiana tags and one with New Jersey rags. Your counter guy said there were no Camrys in a 75 mile radius!!! What’s going on?",0,Negative

"Terrible experience. My first vehicle never showed up to the lot and the sales rep never followed up with me even after I left multiple messages. I had to schedule a new test drive however my original vehicle was nowhere to be found. Vehicle that did show up was in terrible condition dirty and definitely not sanitized for covid-19. When I started it up immediately a check engine light showed up showing that there was a malfunction in the forward braking system. so the vehicle was terrible my experience was terrible and I questioned the entire Avis process. Be careful when working with them.  Update June 27th.  Well a lot has changed since I wrote this review.  The head of sales contacted me to discuss my experience.  He did explain that the condition of the cars like cleanliness is up to Avis rentals not the sales side and that my car came right off the rental. Regardless with Covid, they do need a protocol to ensure the inside has been cleaned.  They also made a big effort to find a vehicle that would meet my needs so I gave them another chance.  The 2nd time around went a lot better.  There were still one or two bumps but in the end, I did purchase from them and changed my review back up to 5 stars.  The bottom line is that if your experience is not what you expect, always let them know and see if they attempt to make things right. In this case it was worth it as I found a vehicle that I was searching for, for a great price.",1,Positive
"I was a little leary of purchasing a car basically over the internet and phone. However I must say they are well organised, they answered all of my questions and process went very smoothly.",1,Positive
Very thorough and seamless. Everyone was very professional and attentive to my needs.,1,Positive

The process was very easy and my financial advisor was helpful and he responded to all my concerns promptly. Most definitely satisfied with my purchase.,1,Positive
"When I asked why the registration transfer fee was so high, I was initially told that was what my DMV charged.  I informed them the fee was 110% increase from my DMV.  Then was told you use a tag agency and that is what they charge.  I was sent my purchase documents, sent them back then was told that they forgot to include a form for my ex-wife to sign at notary.  Throughout the process they felt I should drop everything and handle things, if I took two days to call they sent emails saying they we’re closing my file.  I’ve been working like crazy during this pandemic.",0,Negative
YOU EXCEEDED A FIVE STAR RATING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THROUGH TO THE VERY END.,1,Positive
"Highly customer oriented, very professional, the very best anywhere !  Very responsive on returning messages and phone calls. Very pleasant to work with, and it was always nice to talk to a real live person instead of dealing with recorded instructions to get an answer.",1,Positive

This made the purchase simple.,1,Positive
Robert worked with me on my auto refinancing loan and he was very helpful. He answered all my questions and used multiple ways of communication. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star rating is because the process did take longer then I expected. Overall I am very pleased.,1,Positive
"This process could and should be: much quicker, easier, transparent. Sales rep was lazy and didn’t do anything unless I facilitated the process. Interest rate on loan is pathetic and will be immediately refinanced. Wasn’t even offered a chance to make a down payment but decided not to bother as it would just take more time and make it even more of a process. Couldn’t get original notarized documents accepted the first time and I had to redo them (though wasn’t given an actual reason why or how to avoid it happening again). Literally feel like I sold this car to myself as the reps I had contact with did nothing useful whatsoever. I wasn’t even going to be contacted because the rep was unsure if I had the vehicle at the beginning. Instead of calling or emailing she just put a comment on my account. Really?",0,Negative
This was a painless experience. Thank you!,1,Positive

"Considering this was my first time purchasing a car, I expected a lot of haggling, unexplained details, and the feeling of being rushed. The experience was quite the opposite. The process was very laid back almost. Jon explained everything and even gave me extra recommendations to think about. He helped me get a lower rate and was constantly updating me on everything. Honestly, I would do the process again. In fact, I've already recommended this to close family members and friends. This was a very chill process, and I am very content with the experience.",1,Positive
They were great! Walked me thru everything and it went smooth! Thanks chance for helping me thru the process!,1,Positive
First time buying car online bought a 2019 Toyota Sienna from Avis and our rep was Zee. She was great and on top of the whole process. Got us through the buying process quickly. Would recommend Tresl,1,Positive

Julie was a pleasure to work with. Answered all our questions in a very timely manner. We would not hesitate to useTresl again,1,Positive

Ashley was very communicative and kind throughout the whole process,1,Positive
Today I applied for a refinance on my 2009 Honda Sedan which I was offered come to find out the poop said I was ineligible for it because of the year.Well you people must of known the information about my car to offer it when I spoke to customer service.My car is in good condition low mileage and still have a warranty on it fix the way you offer!!!!!!!!!!!,0,Negative

Jeff Hazard was incredible in this process.  He was very helpful.  He made the process super easy and got everything turned around quickly.  Thank you.,1,Positive
"Great experience! Id definitely recommend them. Im always cautious when dealing with my finances. My finances Advisor answered all my questions and was great about following up with me. Process was actually very simple. All they needed was id, proof address, copy of vechile registration, insurance, and some documents i printed and mailed out. Took less than 30 days and not only has my payment has been lowered by $89 my interest rate was almost lowered by half. Went from 18.50% to 7.09% that's a huge savings. Plus on top of that im getting a refund because i made my last payment to prevent my account from showing delinquent. Just a little more background for those considering refinancing: i original bought my van last year, i spent an entire year fixing my credit raised my score by 100 points 595 to 695. I did look into refinancing about 6 months in but decided to wait because interest charge was not as low as i wanted. I did speak with another finance company open road lending but the service was poor compared to IFS",1,Positive
"Throughout this whole COVID-19 mess, I've been really trying to take hold of my finances and going through Tresl to refinance my auto loan was a fantastic decision. The agent that worked with me was incredibly helpful, extremely patient when I ran into roadbumps on my end, and was truly dedicated to finding the best options for me. Thank god for them, I appreciate everything!!",1,Positive
The service is great! Robert was able to help me. ;),1,Positive
It was quick no question unanswered will used them again,1,Positive
Excellent service!,1,Positive
Maria Solano was incredible in assisting. I however was disappointed in the fact that IFS said some of the documents were not signed correctly which  resulted in me having to spend two hours of my workday to get them re-notarized and sent back.  I was positive we had them done the first time but I guess they said not.   This resulted in me having to cough up 80.00 more dollars out of pocket (my pocket) to get this done in time.   I didn't plan for that in my daily finances.   Otherwise a long but good experience.,1,Positive
I found Maria was very helpful and knowledgeable about your product as well as saving us money. Great Service,1,Positive
"Offer was for 3.99%, since they are a broker not an actual loan company, they have to request the loan from their bank partners, which then came back with 6.75%. Don't waste your time, and don't get a pointless hard inquiry like me. Credit score on CreditKarma 760, current car loan 5.49%",0,Negative
I worked with Robert on refinancing my vehicle. He was very patient and informative.  He would follow up when needed but would not be obnoxious about it (wouldn't call five times in a day).  I would recommend using Tresl to my friends and family and would use them again in the future.,1,Positive
Very easy process! And the people were great to work with.,1,Positive
"The person that finalized everything was incredibly rude to my partner, had zero initiative in working with our credit union, and put everything on us when she should have been finalizing things. When we got the car, it was not what we were told, it was filthy, and we were just disregarded. The only thing that was good that came of this was that we got a great deal on the car. I suggest you stay away.",0,Negative
"The process was generally good. However, I had to regularly initiate follow-ups",1,Positive
Convenient and available.  I would use this service again.,1,Positive
Inattentive customer service. Never provided inspection sheet for vehicle and never returned calls related to purchasing the vehicle.,0,Negative
Highly effective and efficient service that saved me a lot of money,1,Positive
Very professional and attentive. They are very good. Any questions I had they answered with no problem.,1,Positive
The customer I received from Wendy was great.  She provided detailed information about the process and made sure I was locked in to the lowest price even though the price went up slightly after I initially requested the test drive.,1,Positive
"I recently had the pleasure of working with Laura on the refinance of my auto loan.   This was my first auto refinance, and I could not have asked for a more pleasant and knowledgeable Financial Advisor to guide me through the process. Laura was incredibly helpful and took the time to clearly explain my options and answer any questions that I had. She was always friendly, and each conversation with her was an enjoyable one. Her customer service is excellent, and she remained available and responsive, even after the refinance was finalized.    Laura, thank you so much for all the help!",1,Positive
Jason was very helpful.  He stayed in constant communication and made the refinance process quick and easy.,1,Positive

Very satisfied,1,Positive
"Prior to Covid-19 customers had numerous ways to purchase a vehicle. With the shelter in place in my home state of NYC I felt anxiety during this time but this was put at easy while dealing with the finance rep from Tresl. The representative was patient, understanding and answered all questions I had. We spoke many times during the process and each time the level of professionalism and helpfulness remain the same if not stepped up after each call.",1,Positive
I have read some reviews both good and bad.They are both true. My experience with Amy Loza was pleasant and she was composed and patient.She had to try and coordinate with glitches on every level coordinate signings six thousand miles apart between  Florida and Hawaii.It took thirty days and some good luck. I cannot say enough good things about Amy. Happy Mothers Day to a fine person.,1,Positive
"We had a very difficult time with the buyout of our lease.   It has been one of the most painful experiences of our lives.   We have been married 51 years so you can imagine we have purchased or leased many cars during this time.  We NEVER went through anything like this.   Communication was awful.   So many different people were in touch with us, each with a little bit of a different story. As of today we are still waiting for our new title so we can transfer our plates which are due to expire soon.   We do not even know who to contact in regards to this.  We thought we were going through Kia Finance.  Had we known they were sending us to you, we probably would have gone to our own bank and saved quite a bit of money.",1,Positive
"The whole thing was very time consuming. Paperwork was wrong,had to send new ones. Haven't gotten tags yet,or the other key.",1,Positive
Very professional and knowledgeable,1,Positive
"I’m so glad that out of all the financing/funding companies out there that I chose Tresl/ IFS, their customer service is A1, very professional and they go out of their way to help me, the process was easy and fast, I feel better about my new refinancing car loan, I want to say thank you to Terrence Blue, and Lindsey Hibbert, for their help I’m very happy with my new rate and monthly payment.",1,Positive
My experience was great! I dealt with Mark Nolan and he made everything perfectly clear and was so friendly,1,Positive
Matt was great!,1,Positive
"If I could give this Zero Stars I would. This is a complete scam. They state rates as low as 2% with good credit. That's not the case. They want to run your credit to lock you in somewhere around the 7% range. They also claim that they will get back with you in a timely matter, that's not the case either.",0,Negative
The best refinance experience I have ever asked encountered. Will definitely use them again.,1,Positive

"I was very excited to buy my first car, I went to a lot of dealership but  they were trying to hard-sale me, but they were very INFORMATIVE. Than I came across AVIS and I loved the whole pick up the car and test drive so you can decide if you want the car or not. So, I did just that, I loved the car but when It came to purchasing it my financial advisor ""Andres Hernandez"" was not the best advisor. When it came for details he won't tell me all the info I have to fish it out of him. I felt like I was doing most of the work by doing research by googling it, also when I call him it would go straight to voicemail, multiple time I had to call someone else to get in tough with him. To be honest, he might be a good man, but with my experience I'm not happy. But I am happy with the car I choose!",0,Negative
Amy helped me through all the details when the dealership wouldn’t even call me back ( sure it was because of the (covid)) She made the purchase of my lease much easier than I thought it would be. Thank you and thank you GM,1,Positive

AS IS purchase of Avis ex-rental was smooth. I am good with responsiveness of the people I worked with.   Not able to discuss car issues and get any adjustment left a bad taste. There was clear evidence of Avis not doing what was promised in the web version of terms. 3 holes in rear seat. I had no option but fix myself at my cost.,1,Positive
"Purchasing a car through Avis and then working with IFS to finalize everything has been very easy.   I went through a difficult time at a dealership and ended up leaving because they did not sell and finance cars with integrity and piled on extras and then said promotions they were advertising don't apply to me.   This process was far better.   While COVID stay at home was happening, everything was handled by phone and mail.  IFS representatives have been immediately available, responsive to questions and helpful.",1,Positive
Efficient and responsive.,1,Positive
Quick and easy process. Found a much better interest rate thanks to IFS. Would recommend.,1,Positive
"Laura is incredible, most smooth process i had with anything i had to deal with. I will be contacting Laura for any future options. Answering every question i had in detailed. Made me feel comfortable. Words cant describe how great my experience with Laura was. i don't want to deal with no refinance company besides IFS because of Laura. Thank you so much!!",1,Positive
Easy to work with & responsive.  Thank you!,1,Positive
The refinance process was very smooth and the communication was great.,1,Positive
Great job by Mark and the team. Took very good care of us where our local bank and credit union couldn’t.,1,Positive

"It was a very professional and smooth transition from my auto lease to my purchase.  Samantha Frush was very polite, courteous, patient and listened and answered all of our questions.  Thank you so very much",1,Positive
"IFS was great! They took care of all the details of processing and disbursing our payment in our purchase of the car from AVIS. They kept us posted what the details were (e.g., this portion of the check goes to AVIS, this portion pays state taxes, this portion is for title, this portion for registration) and when they were happening (e.g., the registration information has gone to the state and there may be a long wait because the duration depends on how quickly the state processes it). They also gave us a great deal of personal attention. They spent quite a bit of time with us on the phone, explaining what was happening and answering our questions.  They went far beyond the call of duty, however, in one aspect of their service. As it happened, we had a specialty plate that was dear to us and that we wanted to transfer from our old vehicle to the new one. This is not standard and was difficult (technically impossible) to do. We were disappointed at having to give up the plate, and the representative from IFS noted our disappointment and called us back the next day to say that she would find a way to make the transfer work. We explained that we did not want to make her job unnecessarily difficult, but she insisted that she understood how attached some people get to specialty tags and that she was very willing to make it work for us.

"I'd like to take this time to talk about Ms. Velena Schofield.  I am in sales myself and I give her High Marks!!  I am a very particular about what I'm investing in type Human.  I called with frustration and a slight attitude a few days ago. Her demeanor calmed me and she took me into her world and now I am set to look at a car on Friday, and if everything plays out well and there's a win-win deal on the table I will drive away with a wonderful car.  She treated me like the Queen that I am and I appreciate that.",1,Positive
The representatives from IFS were very helpful and understanding during the process of purchasing the vehicle in a manner I have not used before. Took a bit of time but the result was very good. Thank you.,1,Positive
I don't know why anyone would go to a dealer to buy their leased vehicle when they could use IFS. I called multiple dealers about buying my vehicle after my lease was up and they all wanted to charge me an exorbitant dealer fee. IFS charged me no additional fees. The whole experience was easy from start to finish. It took about 2 months to receive the title to my vehicle after submitting all paperwork.,1,Positive

I was a little skeptical refinancing from a company I've never heard of before let alone referred by credit karma but I couldn't be happier. They saved me 164 a month by refinancing! Jason was a awesome rep.,1,Positive
"Overall the service was pretty good. This was the first time I've ever refinanced anything so it was all new to me. Because this entire process is digital it would probably be worth investing in a 3rd party notary service that allows you to expedite the notary process . Currently you mail out the process which adds 3-7 days minimum to your entire operations. This should be unacceptable to your company. Basic warehouse / IT management knows that increasing the flow will reduce bottlenecks and lead to a higher return on profits. You do this by making batch sizes smaller, automating processes, reducing the posibility for errors. That step in your process should be a goal to improve the performance of your operations. Read ""The Goal"", or ""The Pheonix Project"" to learn these critical concepts.   Thanks for everything.  Cheers!",1,Positive

"I was buying a car with Avis however i got to deal with IFS in between. One of the worst services that i have seen in all my car buying process. Initially i was told to go with IFS lenders for loan and they came with 12.75% ROI even thought I had a excellent credit score. When i refused to go with their lender, they increased other fees in my document and made it pretty difficult to work with my lender. Once i paid all my money they moved the process to registration and now they are asking me for more money stating they miscalculated the amount. At this point of time i feel frustrated to work with them.",0,Negative

I will never go threw u again or lease a car. You dragged ur feet by sending me papers twice. I signed both times. My husband as a witness. He checked every paper to make sure I didn’t miss one. Then they sent a brand new packet of papers. You had my money in your account for over 10 days. You stalled as long as you could to make money off my money. I am so frustrated and angry at you. Next time my money if there ever is a next time. My money will be sent to me and not you from the bank. This is the most upsetting transaction I have ever made in my life. I may not buy a Hyundai again. I hope I never have to deal with u again.  Charges like title fee and license fee we were told we didn’t have to pain again. Plus they were over inflated.,0,Negative

Who am I supposed to talk to in order to find out what on earth is going on??????  SOMEONE NEEDS TO CONTACT ME ASAP!!!  This is causing my husband and myself so much stress!!!! Seriously, my plates are due April 14th! Am I not supposed to be able to drive my car until this matter is corrected by IFS??? Or if I get a ticket, is IFS going to pay for that???? We were told it was completed. AND HEARD NOTHING TO THE CONTRARY FROM IFS FOR 20 DAYS!",0,Negative
Thinking of the situation that we are going through it was good. Some time I was a little frustrated because you guys were asking for my Green card even when you can see that I’m USA Citizens. But it was a good ending.,1,Positive

"Our process was less than ideal. The multiple steps seemed to add unnecessary complexity to what is a seamless process at a dealership. Our agent was largely uninformed, and constantly reminded us that she had ""lost of clients in 50 states,"" and was therefore unable to keep track of individual state laws, or even respond quickly to emails with questions and concerns. I have practiced customer relations in every job I've held. I would NEVER tell a client that their concerns were invalid or that I was too busy ""helping"" other clients to assist them. The agent asked us to sign documents with incorrect financial information because it was easier for her, and she did not want to take time to figure out how to fix the issue. We were told conflicting things by the Avis dealership, our first IFS seller, and our finalizing agent. The money we saved using this agency was not enough to justify the hassle. Overall, we would not recommend this process.",0,Negative
Very nice job mark !!,1,Positive
The financing process was easy and painless the only thing that I did not enjoy was the fact that I was getting text from random number and the questions that I had asked  were being answered vaguely. Other than that I had a great experience thank you Jonathan!!,1,Positive
"IFS made the purchase seamless, and they accommodated my schedule as I was leaving the country for a week!",1,Positive
Very pleased with the entire process The only issue I ha which I don’t believe IFS was responsible for is that I received a call from Avis loss prevention that I had not returned the rental vehicle when in fact I was in the process of purchasing it I spoke to Tony and IFS and he resolved the matter promptly I would definitely recommend this option for anybody considering purchasing a used vehicle,1,Positive
Process went smoothly,1,Positive
Everything I expected.,1,Positive

Communication was not very good at any point in the process.  I had to call multiple times to get though the process in excess of 10.  Don gave me several incorrect answers that delayed the closing process.  The funding representative was a little better at responding.  I am still waiting on the Title and  understand that CoVid is affecting that process however the team should reach out on a weekly/biweekly basis to keep us in the loop.,0,Negative

"At first I thought IFS was a phenomenal financial institution. I was rather impressed with the quick, and nifty refinancing of my car, securing a lower APR, and a lower monthly payment. Then days passed, under the assumption my refinancing  had been completed, as my new account had already opened with a brand new credit union. Suddenly, I was getting new letters from my former financial institution, stating that I still owed payments. Perplexed, I reached out again to IFS. This is when their customer service really started to decline. My assigned agent, Victoria, was constantly missing my phone calls, almost to the point where is seemed like she was actively avoiding me. After several call attempts and days passing, I finally got a hold of her, where she redirected me to a relations specialist, Nate, who was also constantly missing my phone calls. Over a week had passed until I found out my car's quote had expired and they sent the wrong check to the wrong address. A new quote had to be reassessed and this one was significantly higher. Victoria, as well as her supervisor, Anthony, gave a totally embellished, nonsensical explanation, of how they used third parties to get a quote and mail my check. But it was clear as day they were deflecting, and didn't want to take responsibility of never checking up on the finalization of my account. Instead, they channeled blame of me, insisting the payoff shortage was because of the interest that accrued on my former account. All three reps were in clear denial and didn't want to take responsibility of the mistake they made. They told me I was responsible for the payoff shortage, and no amount of negotiation would convince them. All I managed to secure was a very minute discount of the payoff shortage, all because I was giving them a hard time. Victoria then gave me an ultimatum: Make the payoff, or they would have close the new account. Reluctant to shop around again, I made the payment.   Overall, IFS was great in securing a new loan for my car. However, once mistakes are made, as happened in the logistics of refinancing my car, they take zero responsibility, and will paint a narrative to make it seem like it is the customer's fault. To sum, my experience with IFS was disappointing, deceptive, fraudulent, and reeking of incompetence.   Reply to Kim from 04/15/2020: If you actually cared about your customers, you wouldn't hide behind an automated default reply. Refund my payoff shortage and issue an apology. Maybe then I will take reply seriously. Get with the times.",0,Negative
"This company was the absolute worst to work with!  I tried to purchase a truck and jumped through all their hoops for over 3 weeks.  They imposed many fees that they could not explain.  After they wanted a hard copy of proof of insurance on the vehicle I did not even have in my possession yet, I called the whole deal off. They cashed my large check and kept my money for over 5 weeks.  I continued to call and got no reply.  I should have received interest on my money that they had in the bank.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.",0,Negative
"Their pre-qual rates are waaaaay off from the actual rates offered from lenders.  Even with an excellent score, credit and employment history, etc... 2+ point difference will only get you a new hard inquiry to low your score for the very poor offers they have from lenders.  Avoid a situation like this and go directly with a lender/bank!",0,Negative
Tons of fees they can't explain. I was told they would file all of my title paperwork as a service to me to make things easier. It's been a mess. They are pushy with financial services and trying to get you to buy insurance through them.,0,Negative
Communication with me during the purchase process was extremely poor.,0,Negative
Purchasing my leased vehicle was easy going through IFS. Staff was very helpful and timely completing the transaction for me.  I would recommend anyone buying out their lease to check out their services before looking at going to your local dealer. I found they were very upfront about all the costs involved and guided me through the process.,1,Positive
"The Financing part went fine, no complaints. Irritated in how getting my license plate to me was handled. I asked about the plate on March 12th and was told the State had sent it to me on March 4th. I had not received my plate and questioned this again on the 16th, the day my temp tag expired. Come to find out, the license plate was in the mail room. The plate was then overnighted but I feel this could have been handled more proactively versus me having to keep reaching out for an answer.",1,Positive

I had to constantly reach out to them for information when they should have been forthcoming with status updates. Even now that the deal is done, I had to reach out to make sure everything was done.",1,Positive
"Not great- This was quite the hassle. We asked for financing options and were given really high rates-5.6%. We decided to use our own lender and got 3.1%.  IFS then sent us our paperwork and told us to send them our down payment. We did that and then were told since we didn't finance with them to send it to our lender. Well our lender already paid them the full amount of the purchase price. They never take down payments - it always goes to the seller. So now we financed a higher amount with our lender due to IFS miscommunication that now we have to refinance with our lender in order to apply the down payment.  The paperwork is a hassle. The titling and registration was a hassle.  We loved buying from Avis and being able to rent the car and use it while in the process of buying, but the buying process was awful.",0,Negative

My representative, Robert, was a complete professional and helped me with everything.   When I was in the process of purchasing my rental, another driver hit my parked car and therefore I stopped the initial purchasing process. IFS helped me tremendously through that confusing accident and I decided I was not going to work with anyone else after it was complete. They helped me get into a second vehicle and that is the one that I purchased.   Thank you Robert and the entire IFS team! I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family!",1,Positive

"I had sent all of my information to Jeff hazard a week later I still have not heard from him even though I was calling and leaving Voice Mail on his personal line on a regular basis.

I finally called the main company number and unbelievable to me he answered that phone and he told me he had been in training and he had told his supervisor to take care of my account, really? Other than that the process was OK",1,Positive
Victoria Garcia was very attentive and made the process smooth and easy.,1,Positive
"Thank you to Laura R., Laura D., Rebecca,  Don and anyone else for keeping me up to date on how the purchase of my Avis rental car transaction progressed. Everyone was friendly, knowledgeable and either called or e-mailed information to me in a timely manner. I will definitely consider using IFS again in the future. The only suggestion I would have is that it would be less confusing if I only had to deal with one or two sales consultants instead of four to complete my purchase. Not that anyone didn't meet my expeditions BUT the more people involved can always lead to miscommunication. Once again thank you to all involved in my purchase.",1,Positive
"It took a few weeks, but my transaction went through without any problems. All the workers involved were knowledgeable and pleasant to work with. At the DMV office today to get my plates, the DMV worker said ""I am always so happy to see one of their (IFS) paperwork transactions come through - they are always organized, complete, and correct.""",1,Positive
Everything went well and was professionally done,1,Positive
Rachel was really helpful . Made me feel safe confident and comfortable that everything was going to be ok and help me through everything step by step. Always updated me with what was needed and she was always in a good mood which made my phone calls to her and emails happy. Never experienced anything like this and she was outstanding.

Jon is the best!!!!!,1,Positive
"They need to communicate more of what’s going on and keep you in the loop better.  Experience could have been made so much smoother but wasn’t.  It took 3 weeks to complete the process.  We were at first told we qualified for a 10% rate that ended up becoming a 5% rate after I let them know that I know that I qualify for better,  based on what I know my credit score is. Between myself and my wife constantly calling and staying up IFS’s “BUNG HOLE” we purchased a Nice Kia Soul for our daughter!",0,Negative

Our representative was most helpful.  Answered all of our questions in a timely manner.  Couldn't be happier.  Thank you IFS.,1,Positive
Excellent service,1,Positive
"Communication was very poor between IFS, the AVIS location, and ourselves.  We kept getting pressured to pick up the vehicle before we even had a written quote of the final pricing.  I kept explaining that I didn't want to take possession of the vehicle without a final agreed upon number because I was afraid that if we backed out we would have to pay rental fees for the time we had it.  We were paying cash, so it should have been a simple transaction.  It took almost a week from test drive to when we actually got the written pricing.  We called and said we would proceed and were told to pick up the vehicle ASAP.  My wife works a few blocks away from the AVIS location so she walked down to pick up the vehicle.  When she got there, they would not send the vehicle with her because she was not on the rental contract we signed prior to the test drive.  We were never informed that we would have to essentially rent the vehicle to take it and even though she had documents with her, they would not release the car.  Fortunately someone at IFS was able to re-do the reservation in her name and send her on her way.  We were then sent documents to sign and informed they had to be notarized and that we had to send a cashier's check.  We both work full time on opposite sides of the city and it took a few days to get that done, but we were pestered every day until everything was dropped at UPS with a tracking number.  Everyone we dealt with was friendly and polite.  It was just the lack of communication that was very frustrating, and it should not have taken almost 3 weeks to purchase a vehicle for cash.",1,Positive
"Thank you for helping me through this car purchase!  Looking forward to next time, and have already recommended Avis Car Sales (ergo: IFS) to some friends.  And also a special thank you to Victoria for her diligence in getting all the paperwork through on-time, her availability for questions, and wonderful flexibility to work with my credit union.  Kudos to y'all!!",1,Positive

"Transaction was smooth and streamlined! Inquiries were handled quickly, and accurately. Very satisfied with overall transaction.",1,Positive
Very helpful through my buying process. I appreciate the help. Thank you!,1,Positive
There were a couple of issues in negotiating the price over some bumper damage. After the representatives at IFS understood my thoughts on this they did an excellent job of getting Avis to negotiate and split the cost to repair with me (splitting cost my request). If there was anything that I would offer as an improvement to your process it would be a little better response time and keeping the client (me) up to date on what is transpiring with any negotiating situation and when the next step  will take place. Other then response times you folks are awesome.,1,Positive
The entire process took way too long and several calls/emails went unanswered when I had questions. I had to nearly threaten to get a temporary tag sent to me and a second one was sent that was not even for the vehicle I was purchasing.,1,Positive

Chance Snook was absolutley amazing and answered all my questions and was extra patient with me and it was greatly appreciated. Customer service was phenominal,1,Positive

"Limited knowledge from the start as well as guidance.   Paperwork package SPECIFICALLY states 3 docs for notary, sent back because it was 5 which wasted my time and efforts as well as delayed everything.

The process for having your vehicle registered is really slow and i had really little help or answer from IFS during that time to keep me updated.,0,Negative
"You did not fund my loan, I brought my own financing. Slower than Hertz, who I have bought two cars from. Still, things seem to have been trouble free. The only problem that I have had would be that I don't have a temporary tag yet, because you don't like the dates on my insurance cards...I guess I have your plates though!",1,Positive
Three cheers for Kara Sellers. She stayed with our case for months while the DMV fiddled with our title. Since we moved out of state getting our title might have been impossible without Kara's help. But thanks to Kara's professionalism and perseverance we finally got what we needed.,1,Positive
"I just refinanced my car thru IFS and it was truly a wonderful experience, The process was easy and  Ashley Jefferson the  Finance Advisor bend over backwards to help me and get everything done in a timely manner.

Rachele has been amazing.  She was very attentive to any questions i had. This was an extremely long process but im glad i had someone like Rachele to guide me through it.

"If I could give 0 stars, I would. This was one of the worst experiences in purchasing a vehicle I have ever had. Online purchases are supposed to be easy and painless and sadly, this was the opposite. I would still be processing the paperwork and purchase of my vehicle, almost 2 months after IFS received my cash, if I had not been proactive asking where we were in the processing of the paperwork. I have talked with the Vice President of Customer Experience and Operations. She admitted to numerous errors on their part after they conducted a root cause analysis on my case, and all I get from my time, stress, anxiety, and numerous hours of missed work, was an apology. I appreciate the RCA being done, I appreciate the apology and ownership of the errors. However, if I had financed this vehicle instead of paying cash, I'd still be asked to be paying the interest on this vehicle. Had I not been proactive, I'd still not have the title and registration on my vehicle that I paid cash for on January 10th. I'm disappointed in the lack of responsiveness to customer service and time spent doing their work for them. I will NEVER purchase a vehicle through these folks again.. I will NEVER rent a vehicle from ABG after this experience, and I hope others are able to find an easier, less expensive, and better way to do business elsewhere!  I will be writing letters to the CEO at IFS along with the CEO, VP of sales and anyone who will listen to the absolutely horrific experience I have had with IFS and ABG.",0,Negative
"Not happy with this company. They pulled 4 hard inquiry on my credit report, said my loan was approved I signed papers, turned my documents in. Got a call next day the lender pulled the loan stating they don't do lease buyouts even though they said they put that on my application to lender. Which I don't believe. Ifs said they get me a loan because that one  was approved but come back and said srry can't help you. You killed my credit with to many inquiries . my credit was great til now. Thanks a bunch . NOT HAPPY",0,Negative
I should be receiving a refund because I over paid my licensing and title work. The DMV sent you guys a check back for $114 and that is my money but I haven’t received anything back. I keep trying to get ahold of someone but no one is replying.,1,Positive
"When we decided to buyout our leased vehicle, my sister recommended we contact Innovative Funding Services. They had helped her and she was very satisfied.

We went through the process sometimes confused as to where we were at and what was coming next.  Out rep. Rachel Schafer was friendly and helpful.  Overall I felt that I was dealing with an organization that did not have a mature process in place.",1,Positive

"You did a good job on your end. Avis however lied about the vehicles they sell. They stated that they have factory approved service done. Not true. Factory states oil change at 5000 miles they waited until over 6500. that first couple oil changes are so important, read the manual. I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IF I KNEW THEY DID NOT DO THIS! Also they state ""no smoking cars"" Mine smelled awful with cigarette smoke smell. I got rid of most by replacing the cabin air filter. could they have not at least done that?  I think Avis should be fined for selling on lies! Also after getting the sale they didn't even want to talk to me. They were so considerate and interested until I made the purchase. I think they should give me a partial refund for an inferior vehicle. Shoot, it stranded me twice in the second week, Push start button and nothing happened, still don't know if it will happen again.  Also the driver door handle, the chrome piece came right off in my hand. And the radio randomly resets itself. There is clear coat bubble on the roof. I didn't know that I should have hired a professional to look at the car first? I trusted the behemoth ""Avis"" I think they sell their trouble cars and should be investigated.  I am very unhappy with Avis.",1,Positive
Staff at IFS especially Alexandra were very helpful and efficient in dealing with the job at hand. I got through the purchase process quickly. I would highly recommend my friends to check out IFS.,1,Positive

"I rated it 2 stars even though the process was smooth. I found out after the loan was funded that IFS did not give me the published rate of 2.99% for 2018 and newer vehicle of the 36 month loan. Instead my loan interest is 3.49% for 2017 and older . I could easily have that rate of 2.99% with my excellent credit scores, 798, 819. I contacted Consumers Credit Credit Union regarding this but nothing they can do anymore because IFS processed the loan. It should not be that way, Ashley J should be more transparent because at the end of the day the customer will find out. I leave a message to this lady after finding out but never returned my call. Check the link it is still there as of today 02112020. myconsumers.org",0,Negative

"I endorse these people if your purpose is like mine - the buyout of my leased car as I saved money as opposed to transacting with the dealership,  There are certain aspects you must pay strict attention to - as I did not - and that is to pay off the final figure with a certified check.  DO NOT USE YOUR PERSONAL CHECK, I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK.  It only throws a monkey wrench in the works and delays the re-registration and amounts to a frustration you don't want to incur.  And they put this in writing, but I still screwed up. Use them, but pay attention. Jay (Ms) Stewart",1,Positive

"I purchased a car through Avis Car Sales which utilizes IFS for the actual transaction. The Finance Adviser I worked with was pleasant and helpful, but the entire process is a bit moronic. I had a couple of questions about the process, so the Adviser I was working with had his manager call me to answer my questions. The manager (unfortunately I can't recall his name) called me and was completely rude and uninterested in answering any questions. He said that he was the boss of all Avis car sales, was bragging about how many cars they sell, and told me that if I don't buy it, someone else will. (Mind you, I was fully interested in purchasing the car, I just had questions about how the process worked). He simply kept repeating something along the lines of, ""this is our process, do you want to buy the car or not?"" Then I would start to ask a question, and he would cut me off and say, ""DO YOU WANT TO BUY THE CAR OR NOT?"" They came very close to loosing a car sale over that scumbag, but in the end, the price was right, so I moved forward with the sale. Because I was buying a car though Avis I had no choice but to use IFS, however, if I were simply refinancing or something and had a choice, there is no way I would ever work this company!",0,Negative

Currently waiting on my state's DMV to complete the process with title and plates for my new vehicle.",1,Positive
I had a very excellent experience with you guys and the lady Laura Deen I talked to though the hole process of buying my car would explain everything perfectly and if I had questions about anything she got back with me right away and explained it all.

"I’ve purchased several autos through the Hertz Sales, but this was my first (and last) from Avis. The deal is rent for three days and if purchased, rent is free.  We rented on a Sunday. They call Wednesday evening with details to purchase/finance. When I informed I was paying cash, I was told there was yet another ($299) fee because I was not financing.  This is in addition to their other non-disclosed fees.   I was also told there was two sets of keys and later told just one.   Hertz Car sales is definitely more customer friendly.",0,Negative

Thanks for your help.  GM Financial & USAA severely complicated the procedure but you were patient & helpful in resolving the sale process,1,Positive
I would recommend this for more experienced buyers and not customers like myself.  I felt a little put off by the first rep we spoke with about the car loan process and starting the paperwork.  Apparently you guys are very busy on Saturdays and don't have much staff there to cover - at least according to the guy we spoke with - Don. I was probably a bit impatient to start and ignorant of what needed to be done and I seemed to get on his nerves.    Other than that it's been good.  I love the car.,1,Positive

Vehicle I bought was in very good condition and 27000 miles. 2018 Ford Focus. Avis made the buying process very easy once I committed to buying the car. Sending all needed documents to my motor vehicle office of my choice was very convenient. And a 60 day temp license but everything was wrapped up in 30. Sales tax were a part of the final sale but that was fine with me. 4 new tires to replace 2 bad ones before purchase was a motivator in buying the car.,1,Positive

I was curious why the taxes doubled when I applied for the loan. It couldn’t be explained and instead of paying 6% Michigan sales tax I was charged over 12% with no explanation. The guy said that I would get a refund once they found out the sales tax of the state that I was in.  So far NOTHING.,1,Positive
Easy decision for me,1,Positive

Every question was answered with a quick call or text. I couldn’t be happier and will use them again in the future!",1,Positive
"My lease was up, decided to buy my vehicle and IFS took care of the process.  No fuss, no hassle.  All I had to do was sign the papers.  Jeff was a true professional and kept me posted regularly.",1,Positive

I recommend Avis car buy to all my friends.  Very helpful and hassle free. Thank You,1,Positive
At first I was kinda skeptical about using this service because I didn’t know if I would get the best deals. But after speaking with everyone I really got the best deal & I couldn’t be any happier with my car. I appreciate everyone going above & beyond for me because I know I was asking a million questions & they answered every single one of them without hesitation!,1,Positive
"Had a good experience, just be aware that it make take a little time",1,Positive
"Very good experience, easy to work with.",1,Positive
The process was not as smooth as we thought it would be. We picked our car up in September and did not finalize the sale until December. We were not given a timeline as to what would take place when and had to figure out it. It was very frustrating.,1,Positive
You sent too much money for sales tax to The state  of Michigan. Michigan SOS wanted to send all documents back to you to redo but instead I bought a bunch of extra BS from the SOS to make up the overage that you sent in taxes because they couldn’t give me the Credit. 2. I was never told by sales person or anyone that this 2019 VW Jetta did not have a spare Or tire and jack in the trunk.,0,Negative
"My sales rep (Robert) was outstanding!  Kimberly who handled the financial transaction was horrendous.  She wrongly charged me for my car registration and this took almost two months for them to correct.  Plus, she overcharged me on the sales tax.  Kimberly said she would refund me the difference, but it has been almost four months and I still do not have my refund.",0,Negative
A great experience overall. It was seamless process with a very knowledgeable agent who keep me in the loop during the entire process.,1,Positive

The process of refinancing my car through IFS was very smooth and efficient.  I didn't expect that refinancing over the internet would be as wholesome a process as it actually turned out to be and would like to express my appreciation for it.  Not having to go into an office or take time off work to address the paperwork was great.  Thanks for the experience.  Would highly recommend IFS to others in the future looking to drop their monthly car note or annual percentage rate and some dollars.,1,Positive

"I bought this car with cash, I have no idea about financing the cash deal went well!!!",1,Positive
Everyone was friendly and helpful. You could shorten the loop for cash buyers however. Overall best way to purchase a car.,1,Positive
"Decided to buy the Rogue about Dec 14th from the Avis site with sale processed by IFS. Paperwork received via email, printed out, completed with required notarization and returned to IFS via FedEx. Cash sale so no financing required. Paper processed over 3 weeks which included Christmas and New Years holidays. We received registration and TN tags, just waiting on TN title to be issued by TN DMV. Also, received second key fob from Avis. Very good experience. My daughter will probably purchase a vehicle in the next couple of months and likely will use AVIS/IFS. I recommend this process and company",1,Positive

"We purchased a 2019 Corolla from AVIS that was handled by IFS.  Every one that we interacted with was very courteous and followed through on any inquiries or issues.  Time to time I ended up interacting with various personnel and each one of them was very professional and helpful.  I will be glad to write a review on any individual if requested however, I would like to mention that Don Dalton that was my main contact went out of his way to locate the second key fob for the car which was shipped to me once the Title was issued.  A couple of observations:  The time from when we agreed to buy the car to when we got the Title was almost 2 months in spite of the fact that we always responded immediately to everything requested from us including the payment.  I realize that some of it has to do with the out of state purchase and the fact that your team was always on it, However, there has got to be a better way.  Even though we were told that there may be only one Key Fob with the car as was with this one, it begs the question as to what happened to the other. It is very scary to have only one Key to  get into the car.  If you loose it or lock it in the car,  you can be in for several hundred Dollars plus potential towing charges.Thinking that somewhere in the AVIS system there must be the other key fob, I was worried that if I did not pursue this it could end up in Key Fob purgatory.  On my request Don Dalton followed up on looking for it and found it. Once the Title was issued, they very promptly sent it to me for which I am very grateful.  I feel that the second Key Fob on all cars should be secured and location identified ahead of time.  On a side note to AVIS.  Please always only give one Key Fob to the renter and not both (on a strong ring)  like Enterprise.  I understand that if renters loose their Key chain, they loose both and then Enterprise charges them a lot of money to replace same. I don't know how they rescue them. Regards, Madhu Asar",1,Positive
My experience with Terry was very PROFESSIONAL. He was quick to assist me & had a preliminary response the same day. On day 2 he was calling me with a offer & confirming my vehicle information to proceed fwd. Thank you all for taking care of me.,1,Positive

She was very thorough, took her time with me to make sure that I understood everything that was happening.....She really took care of me and I couldn't be more thankful.",1,Positive
"Initially I was extremely confused by whom IFS represented in the transaction.  I thought that they were representing USAA, not Avis.  Additionally, I believe that three different IFS people contacted me, therefore, I wasn't certain who to deal with until I contact the last and had an explanatory discussion of who was who in the processing.",1,Positive
still don't have registration or other paperwork. Took until I put my credit card company on it did I get my money from Avis on rental. I sure wouldn't buy again from you. After the sale on your end was done I could not get anyone on phone calls I made.,0,Negative

Great people and efficient system.  I had a very positive experience and commend their professionalism.,1,Positive
Your Reps were very courteous and professional but there was some confusion at first and the original Rep. who handled our loan seemed to have disappeared. Otherwise my wife and I were satisfied with the experience.,1,Positive
"Wheels Inc recommended your company. So, i figured it would be smooth. It was not. It took too long, communication was not the best and short changed the tag agency and i paid the difference out of pocket.

I could not believe how easy it was.,1,Positive
"Incredibly hard to onboard with as I reached out for 3 months before I got a response. Once I got a response, I was very upset and asked if the company was real. I was told by someone named Andrew that it was. I explained that I had been calling and leaving voicemails frequently and if this was a real company, I was told it was a real company and that he didn’t care if I took it to the BBB.

Great Job.   very Satisfied.,1,Positive
Fairly straightforward.  Although they should pay for a FedEx express mailer to return the documents and my cashiers check.  Went with ground over the holidays and it got missorted by FedEx...  took almost 3 weeks to get my paperwork and check to IFS.,1,Positive
Totally painless! Much easier than I have ever experienced in the world of loans.,1,Positive

"I felt somewhat out of control in this important buying decision, not being physically present with the car, negotiating a service package which now it seems i did not need, not receiving small but important components in getting a new car( a second key, an owners manual), driving a hundred miles to receive the car in a small window of time and finding that the car which had been delivered from the auto-stock was a mistake. This was rectified by the service dealer who was onsite immediately and relatively painlessly, only an hour and a half extra time, although thr uncertainty was stressful, people stating on the job past their quitting time to clean up this mistake. That said i like the car, the condition of the car and the purchase price.",1,Positive

"They did find me a good loan but at a cost. There delayed process cost me an extra month of interest on two loans and the fee they charged to do it. They changed people on me half way thru and didn't inform me. Try to find your own if you can, it still put three inquiries on my report. Also the up sale on the warranties will cost you.",1,Positive

IFS was great to work with and made the loan process easy and simple. Great Service!,1,Positive
Very friendly and helpful,1,Positive
Great experience. We even threw them a curve when we switched from cash to financing. Never missed a beat and got a great loan from a well known bank. Reaching our personal rep was frustrating but when I finally called the main line they provided us with what we requested within a couple hours. Would use them again!,1,Positive
Terrific.  Fantastic.  Next I buy a car I will definitely use them,1,Positive
Registration and title arrived late - a week after the temporary resistration expired due to errors with DOT and IFS.  No issues otherwise.,1,Positive

"My sales rep Alex Perez was less than satisfactory, many times needing several follow up emails and calls to get any questions answered over the course of weeks. He went out of town in the middle of my purchase process without telling me or putting my case in the hands of someone else and I had to go around him.   The actual booking of test drives through AVIS was a MESS! Several cancellations and cars not being where they were scheduled with no one able to give much help.",0,Negative
Very smooth process! Mark P. Was awesome!,1,Positive
Super fast and helpful!,1,Positive
"It was easy quick process ????, great rate",1,Positive
The process was quick and super easy! They did all the paperwork while I sat back and just sent in the documents needed. I would've never have received the financing I had by my own finding. I will definitely use them again when needed.,1,Positive
"Although I had some difficulties getting my loan to the company, they were helpful, patient and understanding.",1,Positive
Excellent customer service. Clear and concise instruction followed by a successful outcome.,1,Positive
"Great prices, clerks very helpful. The only issue is that sales representante didn’t heard about my bank before so it took more time than expected",1,Positive
Never bought a car in this way before so I was a little apprehensive.about the procedure. I did have a great contact person who gave me the complete list of what was going to be happen with the steps I needed to do and the steps she was going to do. She stayed in touch with me the whole time and I was able to contact her anytime I needed to. I would not hesitate going through them with my next car purchase.,1,Positive
"IFS helped me negotiate a purchase-from-lease contract so I could circumvent my Hyundai dealership, which on my first phone call to them quoted me over $1800 fees and wouldn't tell me what the fees were for.  I knew I didn't want to go with the dealership and called Hyundai corporate who gave me the name of IFS which I am extremely happy about.  My representative, Kimberly Winner, was superb and within 2 days of speaking with her. she had secured my car loan with Chase.  I would recommend IFS to anyone, and in fact, have already told a friend who leases a Hyundai",1,Positive

We won’t buy with them again. Our car had such bad tires that the wires/cords were showing. We had to replace the tires within a few months. We almost got in an accident (slipping on wet road) and I was frustrated that needing to buy 4 new tires right away wouldn’t have happened if we had bought through a dealership.    They also tried charging more taxes than they should have according to our county’s laws. (Thankfully our credit union represented us and caught it.)   Definitely don’t trust what they give ya.,1,Positive
"Professional, efficient and you all made it so easy for me! Highly recommend your bank for refinance!",1,Positive
Easy process and very friendly communication with IFS team,1,Positive
"Your e-mails are not clear or accurate. On Dec 4, it said, ""In order to complete the Titling process, we need the following documents within 48 hours:""  The electronic systems that transmitted the information to my state's DMV arrived on Dec. 16. Why tell me you need an inspection within 48 hours when I have to wait 12 days before I can even obtain the inspection? The Dec. 4 message was misleading.  I was not impressed with your customer service.",1,Positive

"Convenient, easy, took a risk on me when others turned me away!",1,Positive
"These employees really need to get it together. I went to the BMV 4 times before getting my car plated and they are not good about returning phone calls. You have to keep calling them until they answer. I honestly am not one to give bad reviews. For one I don’t like to take the time and I believe everyone is entitled to a mistake or bad day, but this was really neglectful.",0,Negative
"Extremely EASY way to buy a car, NO hassle, NO pushy sales, NO HUGE FEES",1,Positive
Because this was a cash transaction and it was in Oklahoma rather than Texas it would most likely have been easier if I had just gotten the title from Avis and gone to the Oklahoma Tag Agency and did the title registration myself rather than having IFS involved.,1,Positive
Such an easy process. Gretchen was amazing! Very professional and excellent with follow up.,1,Positive
"The salesman I worked with directly is named Alex Perez. He did a fantastic job! I was extremely pleased with him. With that said, I almost walked away from the sale entirely because of how rude and unprofessional his manager was. The manager’s name is Michael. After having received a check for the down payment and knowing that we were working on getting the paperwork done, Michael decided to tell me that he would be sending a retrieval team to pick the car because I was taking to long to fill out the paperwork. I proceeded to explain that most of this process took place over the holidays when it was difficult to get a hold of people. Instead of understanding, he instead chose to scold me as if I was one of his subordinates. Absolutely disgusting behavior on his part! But Alex Perez was fantastic.",1,Positive
it was very simple and easy.,1,Positive
Entire process was simple and easy!,1,Positive
"Ashley Jefferson is an absolute SUPERSTAR!  I must say I'm not the biggest fan of the way AVIS sells their cars, but Ashley worked with me on financing, and she was extraordinary.  The car needed some repairs to some minor damage that was done just prior to the sale, and Ashley coordinated all of that after the sale (not even really her responsibility).  She followed up with me regularly until the appointment for the repairs had been coordinated, and handled the finance portion of the transaction to perfection.  I had absolutely the VERY BEST customer service experience from Ashley!  I hope IFS values her as much as I enjoyed working with her!",1,Positive

"The process of buying our vehicle took over 6 weeks. Nothing was clarified, nothing was explained, there was a mistake on the application (as in, the APR was higher than it should have been!) I was either dealing with someone who was new or didn't care. Either way, I would not recommend IFS to anyone for anything. I was transferred to a new representative near the end, which helped expedite things but I had a terrible experience.",0,Negative

I have to say that I am impressed with IFS and with my agent Julie she explained everything and all my questions. Very easy to get refinanced for a auto loan I almost saving a $110.00 a month. Thanks IFS and off course thanks to Julie. Definitely check it out it’s worth it.,1,Positive

He made the borrowing process so much easier, so much less of a hassle.  He treated us with respect and dignity.  He tried very hard to assist us in every way and thought of helpful things to include that we needed but we hadn't even thought of, truly exceptional.  I would definitely use their services in the future.",1,Positive

We were extremely pleased with our experience with IFS,1,Positive
"The competitive pricing makes this a very attractive service; however, not being able to see the actual car before going through the hassle of scheduling the test drive is a huge detracting factor. We booked several test drives, having to wait a few days for the car to arrive at the local office, only to find out that the one we selected of the several available had giant dents in them. If even a couple actual photos were shown instead of just stock photos, that would have saved time for both me and the employees who had anything to do with getting the car to the local office.   Some days it seemed like somebody from IFS was calling constantly. During the first test drive somebody called and wanted to go over every single detail of the process. The problem was that this was during the short free period of the test drive where I wanted to focus on actually testing the vehicle. When it came to the one we actually purchased, it seemed like I could not get ahold of anyone. It eventually all worked out, but that process could stand some streamlining.   I am very happy with the vehicle we purchased and really liked the price. The process was a little clunky, but worth the extra steps.",1,Positive
"I bought an Avis rental car. IFS handles Avis car sales.  IFS charged me a $163 processing fee. I was given no choice but to pay it and it was explained they would be doing all the paperwork for me.  IFS is located in Texas. They emailed 24 pages that I had to print, sign, get notarized and send back to them.  I had to send photos of my driver license, the vin and the odometer.  I had to pay another fee to get a Vin inspection at the BMV In order to transfer the title out of Texas.  When I called IFS with questions I was spoken to rudely and felt I was talked “down” to by a manager when I questioned one of the papers that had to be notarized.  IFS provided very little guidance.  This was a huge purchase for me, a big deal.  I would expect them to treat me their paying customer with more respect.  The only thing IFS did for my $163 fee was to fill in the blanks on forms and email them to me so I could print them out.  They did get the title transferred from Avis to me.  In total it took 3 months from the test drive until I was able to obtain my plates.  I felt like I was doing all the work although they were getting paid for it. I do NOT recommend IFS.",0,Negative

"First let me say that after we made arrangements to test drive the vehicle locally, we took possession of our vehicle immediately. Our auto purchase was online and the title owner was in another state, the elapsed time to complete the purchase was longer than walking into and buying from a car dealer. However, the final cost of the purchase was much less and the transaction was handled very professionally by IFS. Considering the circumstances I believe this was a very good method of conducting the transaction and it very smoothly right up through title transfer and licensing. Communication was constant and informative.",1,Positive

"People were friendly and helpful until they cashed the check! That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars, otherwise, I'd have been 1 star!. Advertisement made on the website is false, there's no roadside assistance for free for 1 year, I was told to contact the car manufacturer myself to inquire on the remaining warranty on the car (who does that?!) when it's clearly stated on the website that all cars come automatically with 1 year of free roadside assistance and the remainder of the manufacturer warranty! As soon as you guys received my check, all the questions I had were immediately forgotten, I have sent numerous emails to the sales consultant who was in communication with me without success! Just pure and plain ghosting! It'll be my first and last time purchasing a vehicle through you guys, no matter how good the price would seem! That's for sure, and I absolutely don't recommend others to go through this. Unless you know beforehand not to expect anything and you are ok with that, then please go right ahead! For a company that does all its business through emails and phone calls, you have a long way to go to provide a semblance of average customer service. For the time being, you are not good at all, there's a lot to improve on, starting by replying to your customer's emails!",0,Negative
The whole process was fast and easy. Received regular updates and explanation as to how the process was advancing.,1,Positive
The process was so easy. They handled the licensing requirements too.,1,Positive
"Everything after the test drive was incredibly frustrating, and poorly managed.",0,Negative
"While I appreciated the great price on the vehicle I purchased, I found the service to be extremely slow and not very helpful. The purchasing process was long and drawn out- a process that would normally go quickly at a regular car dealership. While I did have personal assistance and instructions emailed to me, I had to fend for myself for the most part in understanding what steps to take, getting into contact with my bank about cutting a check, going to a local DMV, etc. At no point, was it completely clear what I needed to was supposed to be doing. Overall, I do not recommend going this route in purchasing a vehicle. Especially as a first-time buyer.",0,Negative
Great communication every step of the way. Will recommend,1,Positive
This is a no brainer if you are buying out your lease!!,1,Positive
Never will buy a car from them again ran my credit over 5 time score drop under 5 took over a month to get the paper together,1,Positive

Took months and multiple phone calls as well as emails to get title. This was a cash deal. There was no financing Is there a way to give half a star?,0,Negative
"Ed Flowers was patient, informative and had great communication skills. I was injured before I could return my signed paperwork and he made sure to check on me rather than the needed signatures. I’m so grateful for that. I got a great rate with a great credit union to boot!! Thanks to Credit Karma for hooking me up with IFS!!!",1,Positive

Everything was taken care of for me. Including title and registration. Great service.,1,Positive
Very concerned and attentive to my needs,1,Positive
The whole process felt like it was their first time. Thankfully my bank knew what they were doing but even after we signed and submitted the documents we still had issues and it took 2 months for them to list my bank on the title. They were so bad that when my husband needed to go through the same process and our bank refused to work with IFS again and we had to go through a dealership.,0,Negative

Thumbs up! Overall great experience,1,Positive
The process was very long and time consuming. It was a very confusing process with getting the title transferred and plates transferred and registered to our state.,0,Negative
"I felt the process was rather slow. Thought it might be intentional to build up the rental days. Wasn't given any options for rate versus term. Had to sign some vague agreement online before my rate or finance company was even disclosed. Tried to add on $4000-$5000 in lame extended warranties, tire protection, gap insurance... Be prepared to print 40+ pages of agreement - find a notary - print a temporary tag and find a way to make it waterprooof. Sounded so painless... ended up to be rather a slow pain.",1,Positive
The business service provided was very valuable and the cooperation from Kia leasing services was also much appreciated.  I would recommend IFS to everybody needing end of lease services.,1,Positive

"I would rather get a root canal than buy a car. BUT, if you want a truly painless car buying experience I highly recommend IFS. I have bought a lot of cars and I will not even consider another option. They are amazing.",1,Positive
"Overall everything went well. Paperwork was sent via email and easy to fill out and return.  Everyone I spoke too was helpful and made the process go smoothly.  Purchasing a vehicle this way is only for tech savy buyers. If your not comfortable with email forms and printing signing and scanning you might find this difficult. I had no issue with any of that and felt it was straight forward.  The only issue I ran into was using my own banks financing. I'm a long time customer at my bank and get very low rates. Rep kept pushing to get me to let him run my credit when I was already done working out everything with my bank and ready to purchase. The rep drug out that step out for a few days and said they weren't sure that I would be able to use my own bank since it "" was a small bank and he had never heard of it "" My small bank.... Is US Bank. The 4th largest bank in the US and even sponsors an NFL stadium. Not exactly small as he stated.   After days of waiting for supposed forms from my bank they finally got moving on the sale.  Other than them trying to sell you their own financing this is a relatively easy process.",1,Positive
I love how Jorge Benavides helped me and explain to me how refinancing your Can be.,1,Positive
Appreciate the great follow ups and customer service ????,1,Positive
Smooth process from start to finish. Make sure to follow instructions especially once the paperwork leaves the capable And helpful IFS team as the DMV is where I had the most challenge. Thankfully all the paperwork was perfect and DMV had no reason to delay their tasks!,1,Positive

"The response of an assigned sales agent to my various questions and requests has been atrocious in that I’ve rarely if ever experienced worse. Were it not for his very poor performance or lack there of this rating would have been rated at least a four star star. In fact I would like to talk to a sales manager about this person! // Within several hours of the above post I was contacted by a Sales manager, Mike, though I still feel his sales agents performance was sub par, Mike’s performance in answering my questions, concerns, and minor issues was 5 Stars and correct to an exacting degree, Great Followthru!",1,Positive
I was very impressed with how smooth the process was in buying my vehicle.  I had the best people to work with and helped me from beginning to end.

She worked hard to get me what I needed and got it done! Thank you Aimee Shetley for all your hard work!! If you are needing to refinance IFS is who you can count on! Thanks again!,1,Positive
The communication was terrible. I wasn't notified that I needed a new vehicle inspection until 3 months after everything was signed. My vehicle STILL has not been registered and now I am stuck with fees and penalties and being told I have to complete it on my own. I would NEVER refer anyone to this company.,0,Negative

"The vehicle I bought was advertised as Avis being the seller and there was no middle man involved but learned quickly IFS is the dealer or ""middle man"". An unexpected fee of $462 went directly to IFS for facilitating the sale. However I found IFS professional and easy to work with and am ultimately pleased with the car.",1,Positive

"It took over a month to purchase the car I ended up with. The first one had mechanical issues flare up just days after getting it off the lot. My IFS agent said he’d schedule an appointment for me at the dealership to get it looked at. When I called a week later because I had no dealership correspondence, they told me an excise and that I’d have to go to the Avis mechanic (purchased my car from Avis rentals), and that they’d schedule that appointment for me. A week later, after no correspondence again, I called (still driving the unsafe vehicle) and asked for my appointment time. Again I got an excuse. A week later after personally calling and setting up my appointment I was seen by the Avis mechanic. Yes, the car was broken beyond their scope of practice. So I was instructed by my IFS person to go trade it for a car they set up in a neighboring city. The car set up was the broken one I already had. Waste of time! Got a call from my IFS person around noon telling me if I didn’t take the car to the rental car store by closing time that same day, a Friday, he’d have it impounded— keep in mind none of this was ever my fault to begin with, and I don’t have an alternate vehicle! I canceled my evening plans to take the car in. Paid a $20 Uber to get home. Finally, after I had already gotten home, I talked to their manager who assured my my car wasn’t going to be impounded and that they had another lined up for me, but I had to wait until the next week. I ubered BACK to the store to get the car until the trade was ready. It was a mess from start to finish.",0,Negative
It was easy and quick no problems.,1,Positive
"I had the pleasure of working with Jon Parton and Ashley Sinclair.  While trying to get the car cleaned from the car's heavy smoke smell, the Midway airport location closed the ticket.  This cause a problem with getting my refund, however, Jon and Ashley worked hard to help me receive my refund.  I was a little disappointed,when I was not refunded the $17 for the $1.50 toll fare when the toll transponder was left in the car.  Overall, it was a nice experience and I would suggest it to others.",1,Positive

Great customer service agents all the people I dealt with her very professional unfortunately there was a mixup at the processing end of the things resulting in extra cost for me mixed up with my title and license plate so your partners Let you down in lower the rating otherwise just without that mixup I will give you five stars,1,Positive
"It was a very confusing process converting from an auto lease to a loan, but using IFS as an intermediary worked very smoothly and everyone was wonderful about helping to guide me through. I’m sure if I had gone through a car dealership they would have found a way to tack on an extra grand for themselves, so I am grateful for the service you provided.",1,Positive
The process was so easy and fast. Only had to provide required docs and ifs took care of everything else. They took care of finding me a great deal I don't think I would've gotten without their assistance. The main reason I went with ifs was convenience and they did not disappoint. Would definitely use them again and recommend to others.,1,Positive
